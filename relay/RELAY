DONE

	Load test crypto auth (as used in ping token...)

	Has same performance as crypto sign. All good.

	Extend the relay ping packet to include 32 byte signature and expire timestamp (5 seconds in future)

	When processing relay ping packet, ignore if it's expired.

	When processing relay ping packet, ignore if signature doesn't verify.

	Make sure that all relay packets have appropriate size checks.

RELAY

	-------

	Write code to generate the ping token before ping packet send.

	Make sure if the other relay is internal, then generate ping token relative to internal relay of this relay, and internal address of other relay.

	-------

	On relay ping receive, verify token ping according to internal address of relay if other relay is internal.

	-------

	Relay should have functional tests, separate from sdk func tests, and runnable inside semaphore.

	Start with the absolute basics of the relay functionality, and test everything from top to bottom.

	-------

	Verify relay times out on startup if it can't init.

	Verify relay can init with backend.

	Verify relay catches bad keypairs.

	-------

























	------------------

	Debug why the happy path is not working on linux

	------------------

	Relay should have load test harness framework (totally separate from the SDK and backend...)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in google cloud (driven by terraform)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in bare metal with 1G NIC, 10G NIC
