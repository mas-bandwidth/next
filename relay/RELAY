DONE

	Fixed session map issue issue causing problems with multiple sessions on relays.

	Happy path is still failing on semaphore.

RELAY

	I think the correct thing now is to run the whole backend manually on linux and explore what's going on.

	It seems that the happy path is failing because the route request is sent across, but the response doen't come back.

	But it's strange that the happy path doesn't work on linux, when it does work on mac, and all the func tests for the sdk pass (both linux and mac)...

	How could this be?
	


































	------------------

	Heisenbug on backend func test:

		error: received too many messages!

	------------------

	Work out what we need to do to get pings/pongs setup to use basic and advanced packet filter.

	Make sure we only respond to a ping, if we know about that relay in our list (ping thread).

	Make sure relay pongs are smaller than relay pings, so we can't have amplification.

	------------------

	Add logs for the relay clean shutdown

	------------------

	Bring back the relay version update so it works, but have it off by default, enabled with an env var that is set when relays are properly setup via terraform.

	------------------

	Relay should have functional tests, these should be separate from sdk func tests, and runnable inside semaphore.

	------------------

	Relay should have load test harness framework (totally separate from the SDK and backend...)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in google cloud

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in bare metal with 1G NIC, 10G NIC
