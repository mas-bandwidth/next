	"run soak-test-relay"

	Formalize RELAY_DEBUG 1 in relay.cpp

	Add log levels in relay development.

	Zero log level is no logs (printfs only...)

	First log level is just packets received (like I want in soak test...)

	Second log level is packets received, plus unknown packets and packet filter fails

	Third log level is debug with all packet processing logs

	Fourth log level is spam with all other logs enabled, including printing out tables etc.

	RELAY_DEVELOPMENT -> RELAY_DEBUG

	Build two relay binaries

	relay-debug-[version]
	relay-release-[version]

	Make sure func tests etc. use the debug binary.

	When deploying to environments use the release binary by default (but you can switch with relay version)

	Implement read/write address IPV4 in C++ in next.cpp

	Implement read/write address IPV4 in Golang (core.go)

	Extend route tokens to include previous address (IPv4 only)

	Remove silly hack around next/prev fitting in the IPv6 space for "WriteAddress".

RELAY

	Update route token in SDK

	Update route token in relay

	Verify that happy path passes.

	------------------

	Update relay func tests to work with new token structure

	------------------

	Verify relay func tests pass.

	------------------

	Verify sdk func tests pass.

	------------------

	Add log for relay stdout when happy path doesn't work. 

	Looks like it is randomly failing not being able to send route request packets across the relay.

	The relay may have crashed, or something else -- turning on debugging 

	------------------

	Debug and fix why the happy path doesn't always work in semaphore

	------------------

	Extend soak test to send random session packets

	Should also include valid route token, continue tokens, but with garbage data in them -- to make sure we are safe even if the relay backend has bugs, it won't crash out the relay.

	------------------

	Move the relay soak test into a more official place and have a mode where it can run in Linux for 10 minutes under semaphore.

	------------------

	Verify with semaphore than the update relay receives packets across n threads on linux (SO_REUSEPORT)

	------------------

	Add test_relay_stats func test

	------------------

	Load test relay in google cloud.
