DONE

	Add a zero magic mode to func backend

	Add a test for wrong size near relay packets

RELAY

	Add a test for expired near relay packets

	Add a test for invalid signature near relay packets

	Add a test for valid near relay packets (respond with pong)

	Verify that the pong packet is actually received

	--------------------------



























	-------

	Verify that the relay won't process any packets until it initializes with the backend.

	Go through each relay packet type and verify each counter (eg. received, wrong size etc etc...)

	-------

	Verify that packets with invalid chonkle are dropped (basic packet filter)

	Verify that packets sent with wrong magic are dropped (advanced packet filter)

	-------

	Verify success path for each packet type

	-------

	Work out some way to test relay internal vs. public addresses

	-------

	Verify relay stats calculations

	-------























	------------------

	Relay needs a soak test where random packet data is thrown at it

	Both packets that fail basic packet filter, fail advanced packet filter, and pass advanced packet filter (but have random data...)

	------------------

	Debug why the happy path is not working on linux

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in google cloud (driven by terraform)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in bare metal with 1G NIC, 10G NIC
