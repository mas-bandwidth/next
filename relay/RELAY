DONE

	Double check envelope kbps up/down is properly added/subtracted when sessions are created, destroyed and timed out.

	Calculate packets sent/received per-second for relay

	Calculate bandwidth sent/received for relay

	Calculate near pings per-second

	Calculate relay pings per-second

	Print out all stats and make sure they are valid.

	Verify with multiple relays that all stats make sense

	(packets sent and received, bandwidth sent and received, relay pings received per-second etc...)

	Extend relay to send up start time and current time to relay backend (timestamp).

	Plumb all the relay stats up to the relay backend.

	Update messages.PortalRelayUpdateMessage with new data

	Update portal redis storage with new data

	Update processing in portal cruncher for relay message

RELAY

	Update messages.AnalyticsRelayUpdateMessage with new data

	Update analytics to make sure everything is plumbed end-to-end.

	------------------

	Work out what we need to do to get pings/pongs setup to use basic and advanced packet filter.

	Make sure we only respond to a ping, if we know about that relay in our list (ping thread).

	------------------

	Make sure the func tests pass with the relay

	------------------

	Fix the relay so that session expire comes back. Debug why it was having problems?

	------------------

	Add logs for the relay clean shutdown

	------------------

	Bring back the relay version update so it works, but have it off by default, enabled with an env var that is set when relays are properly setup via terraform.

	------------------

	Relay should have functional tests, these should be separate from sdk func tests, and runnable inside semaphore.

	------------------

	Relay should have load test harness framework (totally separate from the SDK and backend...)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in google cloud

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in bare metal with 1G NIC, 10G NIC

	------------------
