RELAY

	Load test crypto auth (as used in ping token...)

	-------

	Implement ping token with relay <-> relay pings.

	Extend the relay ping packet to include 32 byte signature and expire timestamp (2 seconds in future?)

	When processing relay ping packet, ignore if it's expired.

	When processing relay ping packet, ignore if signature doesn't verify.

	-------

	Only tricky thing is that we'll need to be aware for relay <-> relay pings to encode the ping token as per-internal address for from, when we're sending internally to another relay.

	-------

	Relay should have functional tests, separate from sdk func tests, and runnable inside semaphore.

	Start with the absolute basics of the relay functionality, and test everything from top to bottom.

	-------

























	------------------

	Debug why the happy path is not working on linux

	------------------

	Relay should have load test harness framework (totally separate from the SDK and backend...)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in google cloud (driven by terraform)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in bare metal with 1G NIC, 10G NIC
