DONE

	Implement relay func test framework.

	Add the relay func tests to semaphore.

	Test relay initialize success

	Test relay initialize failure (clean shutdown)

	Test relay name not set

	Test relay public address not set

	Test relay public address invalid

	Test relay internal address invalid

	Test relay public key not set

	Test relay public key invalid

	Test relay private key not set

	Test relay private key invalid

	Test relay keypair invalid

	Test relay backend public key not set

	Test relay backend public key invalid

	Test relay backend public key mismatch

	Test relay backend hostname not set

	Test that we aren't allowed to bind to port 0

	Test number of threads env var is respected, and n threads are created.

	Extend 

	Extract counters from relay stdout

	Verify relay counters for ping/pong

	Fix bug with pong processed counter in ping thread

RELAY

	Verify that relays upload their ping stats to the relay backend (check cost matrix?)

	-------------------------

	Test clean shutdown. Make sure we get to "Done." after counting down.

	-------------------------

	Verify that relays ignore invalid ping tokens, expired ping tokens etc.

	Verify that relays respond to near relay pings

	Verify that relays ignore expired near relay pings, or invalid near relay pings.

	Verify that relays handle changes in magic values every 10 secs for 60 seconds.

	-------

	Verify that the relay won't process any packets until it initializes with the backend.

	Go through each relay packet type and verify each counter (eg. received, wrong size etc etc...)

	-------

	Verify that packets with invalid chonkle are dropped (basic packet filter)

	Verify that packets sent with wrong magic are dropped (advanced packet filter)

	-------

	Verify success path for each packet type

	-------

	Work out some way to test relay internal vs. public addresses

	-------

	Verify relay stats calculations

	-------

























	------------------

	Debug why the happy path is not working on linux

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in google cloud (driven by terraform)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in bare metal with 1G NIC, 10G NIC

	------------------
