DONE

	Verify that relays upload their ping stats to the relay backend and generate a valid cost matrix

	Test basic packet filter

	Test advanced packet filter

	Test clean shutdown. Make sure we get to "Done." after counting down.

RELAY

	Verify that the relay responds to correctly formed near relay ping packets

	Verify that the relay handles all error cases for near relay ping packets

	--------------------------



























	-------

	Verify that the relay won't process any packets until it initializes with the backend.

	Go through each relay packet type and verify each counter (eg. received, wrong size etc etc...)

	-------

	Verify that packets with invalid chonkle are dropped (basic packet filter)

	Verify that packets sent with wrong magic are dropped (advanced packet filter)

	-------

	Verify success path for each packet type

	-------

	Work out some way to test relay internal vs. public addresses

	-------

	Verify relay stats calculations

	-------

























	------------------

	Debug why the happy path is not working on linux

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in google cloud (driven by terraform)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in bare metal with 1G NIC, 10G NIC
