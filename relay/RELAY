DONE

	Print out set of relays when control message is received

	Verify that the relay threads see the pings

	Make the ping thread own the relay manager.

	Create a ping thread.

RELAY

	Setup mutex and queues for control messages sent to ping thread.

	Send the control message to the ping thread.

	Pump control messages on the ping thread, and pass them in to the relay manager.

	Print out control data relays when received on ping thread.

	------------------

	Pass in num_threads to ping_t and add n sockets to the ping_t

	Create n sockets (num threads?) on the ping thread bound to 127.0.0.1:0 on main thread

	Destroy the n ping sockets on main thread in cleanup

	Pass the primary ping socket address (first socket port...), into the relay_t, so all relay threads know where to forward the pongs received (after packet filter.)

	------------------

	Need to bring back version auto update into the relay, but have it disable by default, enabled by env var.

	------------------

	Ideally, relay should have multiple HTTPS connections to backends, and process the union of relays across all backends. But is this overcomplication?

	------------------

	Relay should have functional tests, these should be separate from sdk func tests, and runnable inside semaphore.

	------------------

	Relay should have load test harness framework (totally separate from the SDK and backend...)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in google cloud

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in bare metal with 1G NIC, 10G NIC
