	Double check envelope kbps up/down is properly added/subtracted when sessions are created, destroyed and timed out.

RELAY

	Calculate actual bandwidth up/down for relay

	Calculate bandwidth sent/received for relay

	Calculate packets sent/received per-second for relay

	------------------

	Plumb through all relay stats up to relay backend, to portal and to analytics.

	------------------

	Work out what we need to do to get pings/pongs setup to use basic and advanced packet filter.

	Make sure we only respond to a ping, if we know about that relay in our list (ping thread).

	------------------

	Relay should have functional tests, these should be separate from sdk func tests, and runnable inside semaphore.

	------------------

	Relay should have load test harness framework (totally separate from the SDK and backend...)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in google cloud

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in bare metal with 1G NIC, 10G NIC
