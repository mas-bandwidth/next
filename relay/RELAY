DONE

	Update route token to have previous address.

	Verify that happy path passes.

	Update relay to always use previous address from route token

	Verify happy path 

	Update relay func tests to work with new token structure

	Verify relay func tests pass.

	Verify sdk func tests pass.

	Fix whatever is broken in the backend func tests...

	I think it's just breaking trying to read stdout on linux from a running process.

	Extend happy path to run relays in debug mode and print counters at end. This way we can actually debug when something doesn't work...

	Add log for relay stdout when happy path doesn't work. 

	Extend soak test to send random session packets

RELAY

	Move the relay soak test binary into dist

	Extend relay soak test to have a command line parameter that specifies run forever, or 10 minutes only.

	Setup semaphore with a new job to run the relay soak test for 10 minutes

	Verify with semaphore than the update relay receives packets across n threads on linux (SO_REUSEPORT)
