DONE

	Fixed session map issue issue causing problems with multiple sessions on relays.

	Happy path is still failing on semaphore.

	Add logs for the relay clean shutdown

	Bring back the relay version update so it works, but have it off by default, enabled with an env var that is set when relays are properly setup via terraform.

	Setup relay pings and pongs to use the packet filters (chonkle + pittle)

RELAY

	Verify that relay pings work

	Verify that func tests pass

	------------------

	Implement the near relay ping token

	Significant work end-to-end from server backend down to SDK, then up to relay in pings.

	Basic idea, have a token, secured by server backend key that specifies IP address and a timestamp when the ping token expires.

	One token per-near relay. Otherwise, too expensive when pinging.

	Might need > 1500 byte response packet down to SDK, need to do the math....

	------------------

	Debug why the happy path is not working on linux

	------------------

	Relay should have functional tests, separate from sdk func tests, and runnable inside semaphore.

	Start with the absolute basics of the relay functionality, and test everything from top to bottom.

	------------------

	Relay should have load test harness framework (totally separate from the SDK and backend...)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in google cloud (driven by terraform)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in bare metal with 1G NIC, 10G NIC

	------------------
