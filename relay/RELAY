	"run soak-test-relay"

	Formalize RELAY_DEVELOPMENT 1 in relay.cpp

	Add log levels in relay development.

	Zero log level is no logs (printfs only...)

	First log level is just packets received (like I want in soak test...)

	Second log level is packets received, plus unknown packets and packet filter fails

RELAY

	Third log level is debug with all packet processing logs

	------------------

	Fourth log level is spam with all other logs enabled, including printing out tables etc.

	------------------

	Extend soak test to send random session packest

	Should also include valid route token, continue tokens, but with garbage data in them -- to make sure we are safe even if the relay backend has bugs, it won't crash out the relay.

	------------------

	Move the relay soak test into a more official place and have a mode where it can run in Linux for 10 minutes under semaphore.

	------------------

	test_relay_stats

	------------------

	For route tokens to be secure, they must explicitly use the previous address in the token vs. inferring it from the sender

	Otherwise an attacker can shuffle token order and repeat tokens to create loops.

	------------------

	Update all relay func tests to include the previous address

	------------------

	Make sure SDK func tests pass

	------------------

	Load test relay in google cloud.

	------------------

	Load test relay on bare metal (get some 10G NICs to run locally?)

	------------------

	Randomize the first byte of packets by deterministically adding bytes from the next 15 bytes to it

	------------------

	We need a build process to upload the debug and release relays

	Would be nice if this was included in version, eg. relay-debug-1.0.20
