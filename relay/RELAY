RELAY

	Formalize RELAY_DEVELOPMENT 1 in relay.cpp

	Add log levels in relay development.

	Zero log level is no logs (printfs only...)

	First log level is just packets received (like I want in soak test...)

	Second log level is packets received, plus unknown packets and packet filter fails (low level debug)

	Third log level is spam with all packet processing logs and all logs for message passing etc.

	------------------

	Extend soak test to actually randomly create, continue and send random data across sessions.

	Control this via NumSockets, each socket is a session.

	Should also include valid route token, continue tokens, but with garbage data in them -- to make sure we are safe even if the relay backend has bugs, it won't crash out the relay.

	------------------

	Move the relay soak test into a more official place and have a mode where it can run in Linux for 10 minutes under semaphore.

	------------------

	test_relay_stats

	------------------

	For route tokens to be secure, they must explicitly use the previous address in the token vs. inferring it from the sender

	Otherwise an attacker can shuffle token order and repeat tokens to create loops.

	------------------

	Update all relay func tests to include the previous address

	------------------

	Make sure SDK func tests pass

	------------------

	Load test relay in google cloud.

	------------------

	Load test relay on bare metal (get some 10G NICs to run locally?)

	------------------

	Randomize the first byte of packets by deterministically adding bytes from the next 15 bytes to it
