	Update messages.AnalyticsRelayUpdateMessage with new data

	Update analytics to make sure everything is plumbed end-to-end.

	Does the happy path work with the new relay? Yes!

RELAY

	Do the func tests work with the new relay?

	Func test sdk5 does not pass.

	The reason is because the func tests are binding relays to port 0.

	They need to be adjusted to specify the relay port number...	
































	------------------

	Work out what we need to do to get pings/pongs setup to use basic and advanced packet filter.

	Make sure we only respond to a ping, if we know about that relay in our list (ping thread).

	------------------

	Fix the relay so that session expire comes back. Debug why it was having problems?

	------------------

	Add logs for the relay clean shutdown

	------------------

	Bring back the relay version update so it works, but have it off by default, enabled with an env var that is set when relays are properly setup via terraform.

	------------------

	Relay should have functional tests, these should be separate from sdk func tests, and runnable inside semaphore.

	------------------

	Relay should have load test harness framework (totally separate from the SDK and backend...)

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in google cloud

	------------------

	Relay should be load tested in bare metal with 1G NIC, 10G NIC
