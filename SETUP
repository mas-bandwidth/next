SETUP

	--------

	Update instructions in dev to setup cloudflare.

	--------

	Pain point. Manually enabling APIs is annoying.

	The APIs can be enabled via terraform...

	--------

	Pain point, creating all the projects and service accounts and permissions takes up a lot of time and is fiddly and error prone.

	Solution. Create a terraform job to setup all the projects and link together permissions as necessary. This job can also provision the buckets in storage.

	--------

	Pain point. Manually specifying the service account name is annoying. 

	Ideally, grab the terraform service account from the credentials somehow? Or find the service account by name in terraform?

	--------

	Pain point. Have to manually give the service account permissions to download artifacts from bucket.

	No solution yet.

	--------

	Pain point. Managing secrets is a pain.

	Potentially solvable with hashicorp vault?

	There is also google cloud secrets manager.

	--------

	Next. Create dev relays.
