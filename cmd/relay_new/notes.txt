Smallest packet size is 84 bytes = 672 bits
On a 10g nic the most throughput we could have is 14,880,952 packets/second using a "empty" packet

With a max packet size of 1,500 bytes = 12,000 bits () the min desirable throughput is 789,141 packets/second (floor of 10,000,000,000 / (672 + 12,000))

For a 1g nic processing 78914 packets/second is the min desirable throughput

3/2: currently have ~40k packets/second throughput using route request packets, 2 threads w/ packet size of 1880 bits, in theory 4 threads should be at the 1g bottleneck, but with the packet size so low it should be much higher than 40k

-- proc affinity notes --
irq nums 122-130? I have 8 processors but there are 9 numbers. 122 probably isn't valid

need to test with more than 2 cores receiving/sending, every interrupt is assigned at least 2 processors
irq 122 uses cores 3 & 5 mainly, which have higher than usual interrupts, guessing that number came from the throughput benchmarking
