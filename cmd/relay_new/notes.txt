Smallest packet size is 84 bytes = 672 bits
On a 10g nic the most throughput we could have is 14,880,952 packets/second using a "empty" packet

With a max packet size of 1,500 bytes = 12,000 bits () the min desirable throughput is 789,141 packets/second (floor of 10,000,000,000 / (672 + 12,000))

For a 1g nic processing 78914 packets/second is the min desirable throughput

3/2: currently have 40k packets/second throughput using route request packets, 2 threads w/ packet size of 1880 bits

irq nums 122-130? I have 8 processors but there are 9 numbers. Probably 122 isn't valid
