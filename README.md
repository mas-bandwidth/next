# Setup on MacOS

1. Install brew from https://brew.sh

	`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

2. Install dependencies

	`brew install golang redis libsodium postgresql@14`

3. Start redis

	`brew services start redis`

4. Start postgres

	`brew services start postgresql@14`

5. Add . to your path

	Modify ~/.zshrc to include:

	`export PATH=.:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH`

6. Setup SSH keys on your Mac for Github

   Follow instructions here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

7. Clone repo and cd into it

	`git clone git@github.com:networknext/backend.git`

	`cd backend`

8. Select local environment

	`next select local`

9. Build everything and run unit tests

	`make`

	You should see output like:

```console

10. Setup postgres database

   (something something something... default user is not good enough here)

11. Run happy path

	`run happy-path`

	You should see output like:

```console
gaffer@macbook backend % run happy-path

don't worry. be happy.
