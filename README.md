[![Build Status](https://networknext.semaphoreci.com/badges/next/branches/main.svg?style=shields&key=b74eb8a5-60a2-4044-a0db-cfeab84798dc)](https://networknext.semaphoreci.com/projects/next)

Network Next is a **network accelerator** for multiplayer games. 

It works by monitoring player connections and sending game traffic down an optimized route when the default internet route has high latency, jitter or packet loss.

You decide when to accelerate your players. Set acceptable latency, jitter and packet loss values and only accelerate players that are above them. You can also set how much latency reduction is required for acceleration.

Network Next is source available and free to use when you host the software for your own game with maximum concurrent users (CCU) less than 10k.

For games with more than 10k peak CCU in any given year, a license fee of $25k USD per-year must be paid to Network Next, Inc for each game using the technology.

Network Next, Inc. also offers a hosted solution with commercial support. Please [contact us](mailto:glenn@networknext.com) for details.
