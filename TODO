DONE

	Increase SDK version to 1.2.8

	Add next_client_game_stats function to pass in game_rtt, game_jitter and game_packet_loss.

	Store all these in value trackers, and take the max values when passing up to the server.

	If these values aren't set, they will all stay set to zero.

	Session update request packet should also include game_rtt, game_jitter and game_packet_loss.

	Server stash the game_rtt, game_jitter and game_packet_loss values in the session entry

	Server passes the stats_game_rtt/jitter/packet_loss up to the backend via backend session update packet

	Update backend to read game_rtt, game_jitter and game_packet_loss if SDK version is 1.2.8 or greater.

TODO

	Update pubsub and bigquery schemas to include game_rtt, game_jitter and game_packet_loss in the session update.

	Make sure the values get passed in from the session update.

	-----

	Pass the game rtt/jitter/packet loss to the portal via messages and redis.

	-----

	Update portal to display game latency, game jitter and game packet loss.

SESSION VALUES

	What if we provided the customer a way to pass in an optional set of n float values when upgrading?

	The values could be 0.0 by default, but if set, we could use them to do things like pass in time spent in matchmaking, skill etc.

	8 values would be plenty.






FUNCTIONAL TESTS

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify that we see the correct lat/longs passed up from the SDK

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify that we see server delta time min/max/avg passed up from SDK

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify that we see client delta time min/max/avg passed up from SDK

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify we get game rtt, jitter and pl

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify we get float values passed in from upgrade

FALLBACK TO DIRECT
	
	Why are we seeing so many fallback to directs?
