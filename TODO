DONE

	Main thread next_client_t needs magic updated each time a route changes (new notify, next_notify_updated_magic...)

	Internal client needs to clear client external address and magic values on close session.

	Client needs to use magic value and client external address on main thread packet send.

	The server proxy session entry needs to (lazily) update the magic value post-route update ack. 

	New server notify.

	Client needs to accept both previous and current magic on packet read.

	Server needs to accept both previous and current magic on packet read.

	Client should use magic value and client external address when sending packets to the server and relays.

	Server should use magic per-session proxy entry and address of that session, when sending packets to a client.

	At this point magic should theoretically be working... hahahahaha

	Port across the pittle and chonkle functions plus tests into golang (I think this has already been done?)

TODO

	--------------

	When the server receives a backend packet, the magic should always be zero.

	--------------

	Get the reference backend 5 up, and have it working with the pittle and chonkle -- hold magic at zero for all backend comms.

	--------------

	Verify the server inits gets through, and the server gets a response.

	The server init response should contain the initial magic value.

	--------------

	Now the server can init, verify that server updates get through to the reference backend 5.

	--------------

	Now verify that the server can upgrade a client and exchange direct packets.

	--------------





















	==================================
	Get the client/server upgrade working and the upgraded direct packets being exchanged between client and server.

	--------------

	Update the func backend 5 so it can handle new SDK5 packet types.

	--------------

	Get various upgraded direct func tests passing.

	--------------






























	========================================================

	--------------

	Work out how to get ping tokens down to the client

	--------------

	Get the client pinging near relays w. ping tokens and getting responses.

	--------------

	Update the reference relay so it can handle the new SDK5 packet types.

	--------------

	Get an actual end-to-end network next route going with SDK5 client/server.

	--------------

	Get the rest of the func tests passing.

	--------------

	=================================================

	--------------

	Move server whois to the backend, it's unreliable when run on the SDK server
	and the iteration time for fixes (new SDK deploy) is just too long.

	--------------

	We need a server flush method to timeout all sessions and flush session updates until acked.
