TODO

	--------------

	Debug why sessions aren't taking network next in load test.

	--------------

	Change analytics to perform bulk inserts instead of streaming inserts.

	Bulk inserts are free.

	--------------

	Setup projects and service accounts with terraform

	--------------

	Make sure in production we can scale down the server backends and not fallback to direct

	--------------














Small things:

	--------------

	uPlot graphs really need to calculate the real maximum from the data passed in

	In so many cases, they fail to calculate it. It's extremely annoying.

	--------------

	I need more space on a standard macbook air screen in the sessions list for longer ISP names

	Right now it is way too tight. A long ISP name would throw the whole layout off

	--------------

	There will be a challenge getting prod relays up in AWS vs. dev. There are no projects to segregate?

	Might need to create a separate project, or distinguish resources with naming convention.

	--------------

	Extend initial delay on server cruncher and session cruncher for 120. This will delay them from becoming active until they have had a full minute + to calculate sessions

	--------------

	Connection type detection needs to be brought back for all platforms in the SDK. On linux, connection type was 0 -> "Unknown"

	--------------

	Session counts on relays being 8 when relay backend restarts seems a bit suspicious. Are we not decrementing session counts somewhere?

	--------------

	dev relays need to also be setup to use cloud storage for tf state?

	--------------

	Probably good to provide a way to disable the high priority threads on server with env var.

	When many server instances are running on one server, this can cause problems. eg. thread starvation

	--------------
