DONE

	Theory. Route costs are so random that the route optimization just can't hold any steady routes.

	Instead of randomizing costs, make the cost a function of the hash between the two relay ids.

	This should fix everything.

	Narrator: It did not fix everything.

TODO

	

























































	
	Verify next sessions fix

	--------------

	Extend load test up to 10M with next sessions, now that we have next sessions *and* we have tier 1 networking *and* the c3 quota has been increased.

	--------------

	Fix the fallback to direct when scaling down server backend instances.

	--------------

	Change analytics to perform bulk inserts instead of streaming inserts.

	--------------

	Setup projects and service accounts with terraform

	--------------














Small things:

	--------------

	We need a non-paginated way to get set of database relays for "next relays"

	--------------

	Current sessions on server doesn't seem to be correct, or at least, it is 181 when it should be just 1...

	--------------

	uPlot graphs really need to calculate the real maximum from the data passed in

	In so many cases, they fail to calculate it. It's extremely annoying.

	--------------

	I need more space on a standard macbook air screen in the sessions list for longer ISP names

	Right now it is way too tight. A long ISP name would throw the whole layout off

	--------------

	There will be a challenge getting prod relays up in AWS vs. dev. There are no projects to segregate?

	Might need to create a separate project, or distinguish resources with naming convention.

	--------------

	Extend initial delay on server cruncher and session cruncher for 120. This will delay them from becoming active until they have had a full minute + to calculate sessions

	--------------

	Connection type detection needs to be brought back for all platforms in the SDK. On linux, connection type was 0 -> "Unknown"

	--------------

	Session counts on relays being 8 when relay backend restarts seems a bit suspicious. Are we not decrementing session counts somewhere?

	--------------

	Relays need to be setup to use cloud storage for tf state

	--------------

	Probably good to provide a way to disable the high priority threads on server with env var.

	When many server instances are running on one server, this can cause problems. eg. thread starvation

	--------------















Finalize SDK and UE5 plugin:

	------------------

	Update to latest PS4 and PS5 SDK on Windows PC

	Verify that we can build, link and run across PS4

	Verify that we can build, link and run across PS5

	------------------

	Update to latest XDK

	Verify that we can build, link and run across XBoxOne

	Verify that we can build, link and run across SeriesX

	------------------

	Setup PS4 compilation with custom agents

	Setup PS5 compilation with custom agents

	Setup XBoxOne compilation with custom agents

	Setup Series X compilation with custom agents

	------------------

	Get the UE5 plugin back up

	Make sure to include Flush on the server before the server is destroyed
