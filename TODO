DONE

	Fix backend not having correct latitude/longitude. It needs to come from SDK in session update request packet.

	Client stores lat/long from client relay response.

	Extend session update request packet so it has latitude/longitude in it from the SDK.

	Read the session update request packet in the backend if SDK 1.2.6 or greater with the lat/long values.

	Switch over post session update messages to include lat/long from the request packet.

	Make the SDK pass up the lat/long in the session update request packet when sent.

	Move to dev branch

	Server update packet should include delta_time_min/max/avg

	Session update request packet should include delta_time_min/max/avg

	Update backend to read delta_time_min/max/avg if SDK 1.2.6 or greater

	Update the avro schema so it has the new delta_time_min/max/avg data in it.

	Plumb the delta_time_min/max/avg from the server update to bigquery (avro)

	Plumb the delta_time_min/max/avg from the session update to bigquery (avro)

	Bring dev back up

	Verify that the big query stuff doesn't explode, even with the old bigquery schema

	Update bigquery schemas in-place in dev

	Update the default bigquery schemas to include the new data

	Make sure any bigquery schema changes don't destroy tables

	Verify that the data starts coming in! (it should be zeros...)

	Verify lat/longs are coming up in bigquery in dev.

	Add a new "next_value_tracker_t" to the SDK to track min/max/avg for values.

	Unit test it!

	Extend the server to track min/max/avg delta time since last server update

	Pass up the tracked min/max/avg delta time values in the backend server update request packet

	Deploy to dev and verify we see server update containing delta time min/max/avg in big query

	Extend the client to track min/max/avg delta time since last client update

	Extend client stats to pass up delta time stats to server via client stats packet

	Out of order packets display some weird behavior.

	Disable showing the out of order graph in the portal until it is fixed. Game packet loss (in unreal) can provide the same visibility.

	Extend server to cache per-session delta time min/max/avg when it receives client stats packet

	Server passes up delta time stats to the backend via backend session update request packet

	Deploy to dev

	Verify that we start seeing session delta time min/max/avg values in dev bigquery

	Extend portal messages and redis to pass up delta time min/max/avg to portal

	Update portal to display "Game Delta Time" (min/max/avg) at the bottom of the session page.

	Verify that we see game delta time!

	Deploy to prod.

	Fix so we can handle missing delta time values.

	Separate next/direct bandwidth is annoying.

	Simplify bandwidth processing in the SDK so if it sends or receives a packet (whether next or direct), it is included in bandwidth up/down.

	Deprecate the old bigquery schema values for next_bandwidth_up/down, direct_bandwidth_up/down and make them NULLABLE and create new entries bandwidth_up / bandwidth_down (must also be NULLABLE, because new...)

	Extend to pass bandwidth up/down to portal instead of next/direct bandwidth.

	Combine into one graph and show "Up" and "Down".

	Fix pubsub avro issue with terraform

	Rename "Game Delta Time" to "Client Delta Time"

	Create a new "server_id" which is a 64bit hash of the server IP:port string

	Increase SDK to 1.2.7

	Extend backend to read server id in server update request packet if SDK >= 1.2.7

	Plumb the server id all the way to bigquery

	Plumb the server id all the way to portal

	Update portal APIs to return server id instead of server address

	Show server id in servers view

	Update routing to map to server by id, not address

	Deploy to dev and verify that I can nav around to servers and see server list and click on them

	Debug why the the server lookup by server id is sometimes not working

	It seems there is a mismatch between server id and server address passed up in session update. Weird?

	Fixed. Was using bind address, not server address =p

	Pass func tests

	Prepare prod branch for fast revert if necessary

	Deploy to prod

	What's up with the prod portal, it's very slightly broken?

	Caching issues + all server ids were set to 0.

	Make sure that we are uploading server_id to the bigquery schemas as needed.

TODO





GAME RTT/JITTER/PL FEATURE

	-----

	Session update request packet should also include game_rtt

	Session update request packet should also include game_jitter

	Session update request packet should also include game_packet_loss

	-----

	Update backend to read game_rtt, game_jitter and game_packet_loss if SDK version is 1.2.6 or greater.

	-----

	Functional test to verify that we see client game rtt, jitter and packet loss passed up from SDK

	-----

	Update portal to display game latency, game jitter and game packet loss.

	-----






SERVER SLICE FEATURE

	Extend server portal data to have a ServerSlice data modelled after the session slice.

	Add a graph to the portal showing the "Server Delta Time". This would be a great feature to have in the portal!






SESSION VALUES

	What if we provided the customer a way to pass in an optional set of n float values when upgrading?

	The values could be 0.0 by default, but if set, we could use them to do things like pass in time spent in matchmaking, skill etc.

	8 values would be plenty.






FUNCTIONAL TESTS

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify that we see the correct lat/longs passed up from the SDK

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify that we see server delta time min/max/avg passed up from SDK

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify that we see client delta time min/max/avg passed up from SDK

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify we get game rtt, jitter and pl

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify we get float values passed in from upgrade

	-----





FALLBACK TO DIRECT
	
	Why are we seeing so many fallback to directs?
