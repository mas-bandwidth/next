DONE

	Fix backend not having correct latitude/longitude. It needs to come from SDK in session update request packet.

	Client stores lat/long from client relay response.

	Extend session update request packet so it has latitude/longitude in it from the SDK.

	Read the session update request packet in the backend if SDK 1.2.6 or greater with the lat/long values.

	Switch over post session update messages to include lat/long from the request packet.

	Make the SDK pass up the lat/long in the session update request packet when sent.

	Move to dev branch

	Server update packet should include delta_time_min/max/avg

	Session update request packet should include delta_time_min/max/avg

	Update backend to read delta_time_min/max/avg if SDK 1.2.6 or greater

	Update the avro schema so it has the new delta_time_min/max/avg data in it.

	Plumb the delta_time_min/max/avg from the server update to bigquery (avro)

	Plumb the delta_time_min/max/avg from the session update to bigquery (avro)

	Bring dev back up

	Verify that the big query stuff doesn't explode, even with the old bigquery schema

	Update bigquery schemas in-place in dev

	Update the default bigquery schemas to include the new data

	Make sure any bigquery schema changes don't destroy tables

	Verify that the data starts coming in! (it should be zeros...)

	Verify lat/longs are coming up in bigquery in dev.

	Add a new "next_value_tracker_t" to the SDK to track min/max/avg for values.

	Unit test it!

	Extend the server to track min/max/avg delta time since last server update

	Pass up the tracked min/max/avg delta time values in the backend server update request packet

	Deploy to dev and verify we see server update containing delta time min/max/avg in big query

TODO

	Extend the client to track min/max/avg delta time since last client update

	Extend client stats to pass up delta time stats to server via client stats packet

	Extend server to pass up per-session delta time stats to the backend via session update request packet

	-----

	Verify that we start seeing non-zero client and server delta time values in big query in dev.

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify that we see the correct lat/longs passed up from the SDK

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify that we see server delta time min/max/avg passed up from SDK

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify that we see client delta time min/max/avg passed up from SDK

GAME RTT/JITTER/PL FEATURE

	-----

	Session update request packet should also include game_rtt_min/max/avg

	Session update request packet should also include game_jitter_min/max/avg

	Session update request packet should also include game_packet_loss_min/max/avg

	-----

	Update backend to read game_rtt_*, game_jitter_* and game_packet_loss_* if SDK version is 1.2.6 or greater.

	-----

	Functional test to verify that we see client game rtt min/max/avg passed up from SDK

	-----

	Functional test to verify that we see client game jitter min/max/avg passed up from SDK

	-----

	Functional test to verify that we see client game packet loss min/max/avg passed up from SDK
