DONE

	Verify staging is up.

	Found the issues. Cloudflare basically had a bunch of old DNS records set.

	Verify prod is up.

	Dev is still not up?

	Verify that we can actually see https://portal-dev.virtualgo.net up.

	Modify amazon relay setup code so it prefixes resources with env, eg. "dev-", or "prod-"

	Modify akamai/linode relay setup code so it prefixes resources with env

	Setup relays in dev

	Modify vultr setup script so it prefixes with env

	Relays are initially showing as offline, even though I have set them up and started them. Why?

	I'm pretty sure that the comms from relay gateway -> relay backend is broken

	Perhaps the relay gateway doesn't have permissions to get the MIG data?

	Confirmed. Added the permissions across dev, staging and prod.

TODO	

	Eat your own dogfood and setup a maximally provisioned set of cloud relays in USA in dev

	Setup a test customer with the SDK and verify that I can actually see some acceleration

	-------------












	-------------

	Configure script to set company name, modify stuff etc. Idea is run "./configure" and enter some data, and everything is setup for you. *** Zero work. ***

	Should also roll relay backend, server backend keys... api keys etc.
	
	-------------

	Automatically setup the "development" database in postgres and load the create.sql

	Looks like this can only be done with gcloud:

		gcloud sql import sql INSTANCE_NAME gs://BUCKET_NAME/IMPORT_FILE_NAME --database=DATABASE_NAME

	----------

	Integrate new API key module in api.go

	---------- 

	Integrate map with portal

	----------

	Work out portal security model

	----------

	Finalize SDK

	----------

	Finalize UE5 plugin

	----------

	Fix singlethreaded relay

	----------

	Write documentation

	----------


























Small things:

	----------

	If no time series data in time period, fill with zeros.

	----------

	Sessions being out of order in the portal in staging is weird. I have no explanation for this, at the moment.

	----------

	Portal redis having 10-15 second 95th percentile write time seems bad @ 10M relays...

	----------

	Make sure the system can run with no relays in dev and production (eg. analysis only initially...)

	----------

	For providers like akamai, vultr, amazon, we need to prefix all resource names with env (because their aren't separate projects...)

	--------------

	Clean up old ip2location database files in server backend

	--------------

	Extend session update so it sends all sessions to portal below 100k sessions total, even if portal next sessions only is set

	--------------

	Y axis labels spill over the right side when they get up to 100,000, 1,000,000 etc... convert to 500K, 1M, 2M?

	--------------

	Current sessions on server doesn't seem to be correct, or at least, it is 181 when it should be just 1...

	--------------

	I need more space on a standard macbook air screen in the sessions list for longer ISP names

	Right now it is way too tight. A long ISP name would throw the whole layout off

	--------------

	Connection type detection needs to be brought back for all platforms in the SDK. On linux, connection type was 0 -> "Unknown"

	--------------

	Session counts on relays being 8 when relay backend restarts seems a bit suspicious. Are we not decrementing session counts somewhere?

	--------------

	Disable high priority threads by default on the server. It can cause problems when many server instances are run per-machine.
