	Verify func tests pass with sdk5

	Func test to make sure that next_server_ready becomes true on the successful path "welcome to network next :)" and datacenter is set on success path.

	Func test to make sure that next_server_ready becomes true, when the server can't init with the backend (eg. ready post-init timeout...)

	Func test for disable autodetect, and no autodetect code runs "cloud".

	Func test to make sure that next_server_ready becomes true, when the autodetect times out.

	Func test to make sure we still receive packets while an autodetect runs long (fix bug with packet receive thread being blocked on autodetect completing...)
