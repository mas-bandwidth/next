TODO	

	Relay graphs need to be sent at 1 minute intervals, not 1 second. The graphs are too dense, and they are overloading the time series redis @ 1000 relays.

	----------

	Setup production again and verify we can hit 100k scale with raspberry

	----------

	Setup projects and service accounts with terraform

	----------

	Integrate new API key module in api.go

	---------- 

	Integrate map with portal

	----------

	Work out portal security model

	----------

	Finalize SDK

	----------

	Finalize UE5 plugin

	----------

	Fix singlethreaded relay

	----------

	Write documentation

	----------


























Small things:

	----------

	Calling sessions "next" is fine for code, but in the portal we should refer to it as accelerated.

	That way if somebody rebrands the portal internally, stuff will still make sense vs. "next sessions" (what's that?)

	----------

	Make sure the system can run with no relays in dev and production (eg. analysis only initially...)

	----------

	Relays need to be setup to use cloud storage for tf state

	----------

	For providers like akamai, vultr, amazon, we need to prefix all resource names with env (because their aren't separate projects...)

	--------------

	Clean up old ip2location database files in server backend

	--------------

	User hash link in server sessions page is not working

	--------------

	Just leave the buyer page as graphs. The rightmost column doesn't add enough to justify its existence.

	--------------

	Extend session update so it sends all sessions to portal below 100k sessions total, even if portal next sessions only is set

	--------------

	Y axis labels spill over the right side when they get up to 100,000, 1,000,000 etc... convert to 500K, 1M, 2M?

	--------------

	Current sessions on server doesn't seem to be correct, or at least, it is 181 when it should be just 1...

	--------------

	I need more space on a standard macbook air screen in the sessions list for longer ISP names

	Right now it is way too tight. A long ISP name would throw the whole layout off

	--------------

	There will be a challenge getting prod relays up in AWS vs. dev. There are no projects to segregate?

	Might need to create a separate project, or distinguish resources with naming convention.

	--------------

	Connection type detection needs to be brought back for all platforms in the SDK. On linux, connection type was 0 -> "Unknown"

	--------------

	Session counts on relays being 8 when relay backend restarts seems a bit suspicious. Are we not decrementing session counts somewhere?

	--------------

	Disable high priority threads on server by default. It can cause problems when many server instances are run per-machine.
