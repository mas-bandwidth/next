DONE

	Shut down staging

	Bring across to production env and update it so that it has no portal cruncher, and everything is setup

TODO

	Verify that we have no leader election issues with relay backend in prod

	Verify that we have no fallback to direct issues with server backend in prod

	Verify that click on server to see server sessions works in prod

	----------

	Solve the problem with 1000 relays in staging

	----------

	Ingest into bigquery with google pubsub

	"Better yet, you no longer need to pay for data ingestion into BigQuery when using this new direct method. You only pay for the Pub/Sub you use. Ingestion from Pub/Subâ€™s BigQuery subscription into BigQuery costs $50/TiB based on read (subscribe throughput) from the subscription. This is a simpler and cheaper billing experience compared to the alternative path via Dataflow pipeline where you would be paying for the Pub/Sub read, Dataflow job, and BigQuery data ingestion. See the pricing page for details."

Small things:

	--------------

	Just leave the buyer page as graphs. The rightmost column doesn't add enough to justify its existence.

	--------------

	Click on server to see sessions on server is broken in staging even at small load. My guess, sessions are not properly linking to server addresses?

	--------------

	Active relays seems to double during deploys. Currently, I cannot think of any reason why this would happen?

	--------------

	Extend session update so it sends all sessions to portal below 100k sessions total, even if portal next sessions only is set

	--------------

	Relay graphs need to be aggregated (time series) into per-minute values. Use average.

	--------------

	Y axis labels spill over the right side when they get up to 100,000, 1,000,000 etc... convert to 500K, 1M, 2M?

	--------------

	Current sessions on server doesn't seem to be correct, or at least, it is 181 when it should be just 1...

	--------------

	uPlot graphs really need to calculate the real maximum from the data passed in

	In so many cases, they fail to calculate it. It's extremely annoying.

	--------------

	I need more space on a standard macbook air screen in the sessions list for longer ISP names

	Right now it is way too tight. A long ISP name would throw the whole layout off

	--------------

	There will be a challenge getting prod relays up in AWS vs. dev. There are no projects to segregate?

	Might need to create a separate project, or distinguish resources with naming convention.

	--------------

	Connection type detection needs to be brought back for all platforms in the SDK. On linux, connection type was 0 -> "Unknown"

	--------------

	Session counts on relays being 8 when relay backend restarts seems a bit suspicious. Are we not decrementing session counts somewhere?

	--------------

	Probably good to provide a way to disable the high priority threads on server with env var.

	When many server instances are running on one server, this can cause problems. eg. thread starvation
