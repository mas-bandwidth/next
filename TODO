	Verify func tests pass with sdk5

TODO

	Bring across server flush func tests.

	Bring across server event func tests.

	Bring across match data func tests.

	-----------------------

	Func test to make sure that next_server_ready becomes true on the successful path "welcome to network next :)" and datacenter is set on success path.

	Func test to make sure that next_server_ready becomes true, when the server can't init with the backend (eg. ready post-init timeout...)

	Func test to make sure that next_server_ready becomes true, when the whois times out.

	Func test to make sure that next_server_ready becomes true, when the autodetect times out.

	-----------------------

	Func test for disable autodetect, and no autodetect code runs (try with "cloud" and with "multiplay.[cityname]")

	-----------------------

	Func test to make sure that even if whois and autodetect timeouts are disabled, the init times out after 10 seconds, next_server_ready becomes true and we have the datacenter.

	-----------------------

	Func test to make sure we still receive packets while an autodetect runs long (fix bug with packet receive thread being blocked on autodetect completing...)

	-----------------------

	Func test for multiplay failure autodetect -> multiplay.[cityname], ready is true and datacenter is set.

	Func test to make sure we can parse the whois to get the multiplay supplier, eg. stash a whois.txt with inap or whatever, and make sure multiplay autodetect works.

	Func test to make sure that multiplay whois caches the whois.txt file after running whois successfully.

	-----------------------

	Func test for "cloud" autodetect running GCP and AWS autodetects via logs.

	----------------------------------------------------

	Extend SDK5 to pass in the mean direct RTT

	----------------------------------------------------

	Extend SDK5 to pass in the direct bandwidth in kbps up/down, not just sending actual bandwidth when on next.

	----------------------------------------------------

	Add any func tests necessary to test the mean direct RTT and direct bandwidth usage.

	----------------------------------------------------
