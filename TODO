DONE

	Increase SDK version to 1.2.8

	Add next_client_game_stats function to pass in game_rtt, game_jitter and game_packet_loss.

	Store all these in value trackers, and take the max values when passing up to the server.

	If these values aren't set, they will all stay set to zero.

	Session update request packet should also include game_rtt, game_jitter and game_packet_loss.

	Server stash the game_rtt, game_jitter and game_packet_loss values in the session entry

	Server passes the stats_game_rtt/jitter/packet_loss up to the backend via backend session update packet

	Update backend to read game_rtt, game_jitter and game_packet_loss if SDK version is 1.2.8 or greater.

	Update pubsub and bigquery schemas to include game_rtt, game_jitter and game_packet_loss in the session update.

	Make sure the values get passed in from the session update.

	Pass the game rtt/jitter/packet loss to server backend via portal message

	Mock up game rtt, jitter and packet loss values in raspberry clients.

	Verify we see game_rtt, game_jitter and game_packet_loss values in bigquery in dev.

	Game RTT is correct

	Game jitter is broken

	Game packet loss is broken

	Verified fix.

	Insert the game rtt/jitter/packet loss into redis via the session inserter

	Update portal to display game latency, game jitter and game packet loss.

	Verify that we see game rtt, jitter and PL in the portal.

	Deploy to prod

	Verify we see zero values for game rtt, jitter and PL in portal.

	Stop tracking next and direct bandwidth up/down on the client

	Just track total bandwidth period (total bandwidth received in-order, whether next or direct...)

	Adjust the stats packets to pass up only bandwidth_up / bandwidth_down

	Deploy to prod.

	Verify correct prod display (zero values for game rtt, jitter and PL).

	Need to wait a bit for caching issues to resolve.

TODO

	I broke something in the SDK -> backend comms. Data so far indicates it's in the server init.	







FALLBACK TO DIRECT

	Why are we seeing so many fallback to directs?

	Instrument the bigquery data with enough information to see what is causing the fallback to direct	s.







FUNCTIONAL TESTS

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify that we see the correct lat/longs passed up from the SDK

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify that we see server delta time min/max/avg passed up from SDK

	-----

	Add a functional test to verify we get game rtt, jitter and pl

	-----






ADD TO PLUGIN

	Pass in rtt, jitter and PL estimates from unreal engine each frame to next_client_game_stats function
