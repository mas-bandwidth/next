TODO

	We need to see a steady route matrix across deploys. Work out what is going on with leader election and the new instance sending time series and counter data

	I think it is simply that we need to add an initial delay that gets past the history buffer

	--------------

	There seems to be a load related issue @ 1000 relays.

	--------------

	Portal crunchers seem to be a bottleneck in scaling up.

	--------------

	Click on server and get server sessions seems to be broken in staging. Doesn't seem load related.

	--------------

	Change analytics to perform bulk inserts instead of streaming inserts.

	--------------













Small things:

	--------------

	Extend session update so it sends all sessions to portal below 100k sessions total, even if portal next sessions only is set

	--------------

	If portal cruncher can't keep up, session counts will fall... this is weird.

	--------------

	We should not trigger "session_update" counter on retries.

	--------------

	When redis sample stretching starts to happen, slices can get out of order, which really messes up the graphs.

	--------------

	Relay graphs need to be aggregated (time series) into per-minute values. Use average.

	--------------

	Y axis labels spill over the right side when they get up to 100,000, 1,000,000 etc... convert to 500K, 1M, 2M?

	--------------

	Current sessions on server doesn't seem to be correct, or at least, it is 181 when it should be just 1...

	--------------

	uPlot graphs really need to calculate the real maximum from the data passed in

	In so many cases, they fail to calculate it. It's extremely annoying.

	--------------

	I need more space on a standard macbook air screen in the sessions list for longer ISP names

	Right now it is way too tight. A long ISP name would throw the whole layout off

	--------------

	There will be a challenge getting prod relays up in AWS vs. dev. There are no projects to segregate?

	Might need to create a separate project, or distinguish resources with naming convention.

	--------------

	Connection type detection needs to be brought back for all platforms in the SDK. On linux, connection type was 0 -> "Unknown"

	--------------

	Session counts on relays being 8 when relay backend restarts seems a bit suspicious. Are we not decrementing session counts somewhere?

	--------------

	Probably good to provide a way to disable the high priority threads on server with env var.

	When many server instances are running on one server, this can cause problems. eg. thread starvation

	--------------










Finalize terraform and document:

	--------------

	Setup projects and service accounts with terraform

	--------------

	Relays need to be setup to use cloud storage for tf state

	--------------








Finalize SDK and UE5 plugin:

	------------------

	Update to latest PS4 and PS5 SDK on Windows PC

	Verify that we can build, link and run across PS4

	Verify that we can build, link and run across PS5

	------------------

	Update to latest XDK

	Verify that we can build, link and run across XBoxOne

	Verify that we can build, link and run across SeriesX

	------------------

	Setup PS4 compilation with custom agents

	Setup PS5 compilation with custom agents

	Setup XBoxOne compilation with custom agents

	Setup Series X compilation with custom agents

	------------------

	Get the UE5 plugin back up

	Make sure to include Flush on the server before the server is destroyed
