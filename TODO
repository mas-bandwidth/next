DONE

	Fix backend not having correct latitude/longitude. It needs to come from SDK in session update request packet.

	Client stores lat/long from client relay response.

	Extend session update request packet so it has latitude/longitude in it from the SDK.

	Read the session update request packet in the backend if SDK 1.2.6 or greater with the lat/long values.

	Switch over post session update messages to include lat/long from the request packet.

	Make the SDK pass up the lat/long in the session update request packet when sent.

	Move to dev branch

	Server update packet should include delta_time_min/max/avg

	Session update request packet should include delta_time_min/max/avg

	Update backend to read delta_time_min/max/avg if SDK 1.2.6 or greater

	Update the avro schema so it has the new delta_time_min/max/avg data in it.

	Plumb the delta_time_min/max/avg from the server update to bigquery (avro)

	Plumb the delta_time_min/max/avg from the session update to bigquery (avro)

TODO

	Bring dev back up

	Verify that the big query stuff doesn't explode, even with the old bigquery schema

	Work out how to apply bigquery changes post-spin up, ideally save to .sql file or whatever

	-----

	Update the default bigquery schemas to include the new data

	-----

	Functional test to verify that we see the correct lat/longs passed up from the SDK

	-----

	Functional test to verify that we see server delta time min/max/avg passed up from SDK

	-----

	Functional test to verify that we see client delta time min/max/avg passed up from SDK

GAME RTT/JITTER/PL FEATURE

	-----

	Session update request packet should also include game_rtt_min/max/avg

	Session update request packet should also include game_jitter_min/max/avg

	Session update request packet should also include game_packet_loss_min/max/avg

	-----

	Update backend to read game_rtt_*, game_jitter_* and game_packet_loss_* if SDK version is 1.2.6 or greater.

	-----

	Functional test to verify that we see client game rtt min/max/avg passed up from SDK

	-----

	Functional test to verify that we see client game jitter min/max/avg passed up from SDK

	-----

	Functional test to verify that we see client game packet loss min/max/avg passed up from SDK
