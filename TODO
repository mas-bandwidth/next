DONE

	Fix the backend packets

	Heisenbug in test_relay_manager (?!)

	It was benign and timing related. Fixed.

	Setup a new repo called "sdk5"

	Submodule "sdk5" into the backend repo.

	Apply read/peek header no assert fixes to sdk4

	Remove the "chonkle" branch entirely from sdk repo

	Get the sdk5 building under backend repo

	Implement ref_backend5

	Implement func_test5

TODO

	--------------

	reference backend5 needs golang functions for chonkle, pittle generation, simple packet filter, complex packet filter.

	--------------

	Initially, when getting everything working, magic will be held at zero.

	--------------

	Update the ref backend 5 so the server5 can talk with it

	This means:

		1. server init request
		2. server init response
		3. session update

	Packets all get through and their responses are handled by the SDK.

	--------------

	Once the server5 can talk with backend5, pass over next.cpp so upgrade passes

	This means that:

		1. upgrade request
		2. upgrade response
		3. upgrade ack

	Packets all get sent, received and processed, and the client and server can exchange packets over direct packets.

	--------------

	Get the direct packet func test passing.

	--------------

	Extend the relay so it knows how to process SDK5 packets.

	--------------

	Work out how to get ping tokens down to the client

	--------------

	Get the client pinging near relays w. ping tokens and getting responses.

	--------------

	Get a func test working with a network next route.

	--------------

	Now we need to work out how to make magic dynamic.

	--------------

	Get rest of func tests passing

	--------------

	Switch the routing keypair and store it via a secret.

	Don't actually put it in the code anywhere.

	The only person who knows the keypair should be me.
