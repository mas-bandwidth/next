DONE

	Verify func tests pass with sdk5

	Func test to make sure that next_server_ready becomes true on the successful path "welcome to network next :)" and datacenter is set on success path.

	Func test to make sure that next_server_ready becomes true, when the server can't init with the backend (eg. ready post-init timeout...)

	Func test for disable autodetect, and no autodetect code runs "cloud".

	Func test for disable autodetect, and no autodetect code runs "multiplay.newyork".

TODO

	-----------------------

	Func test to make sure that next_server_ready becomes true, when the whois times out.

	Func test to make sure that next_server_ready becomes true, when the autodetect times out.

	Func test to make sure that even if whois and autodetect timeouts are disabled, the init times out after 10 seconds, next_server_ready becomes true and we have the datacenter.

	Func test to make sure we still receive packets while an autodetect runs long (fix bug with packet receive thread being blocked on autodetect completing...)

	-----------------------

	Bring across server flush func tests.

	Bring across server event func tests.

	Bring across match data func tests.

	Extend SDK5 to pass in the mean direct RTT

	Extend SDK5 to pass in the direct bandwidth in kbps up/down, not just sending actual bandwidth when on next.

	----------------------------------------------------

	Add func test necessary for mean direct RTT

	----------------------------------------------------

	Add func test necessary for direct bandwidth up/down actual usage in kbps
