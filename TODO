	Use queries to look for bad things

	Fallback to direct is happening a lot (thousands of times a day)

	Fallback to direct error is not showing up in error code.

	SessionError_Aborted = (1 << 5) seems to be happening semi-frequently (hundreds of times a day)

	Bad slice number (512) is happening extremely rarely. a few a day...

	A lot of route_no_longer_exists are happening, 1000s a day.

	Latency worse is happening less than 100 times a day.

	Mispredict is happening thousands of times a day.

TODO

	Best thing I can do is try disabling the mispredict.
























	Would be nice if I could get the session counts over to the left a bit so I don't need to include scrollbar in screenshots...
