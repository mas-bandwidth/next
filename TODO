DONE

	reference backend5 needs golang functions for chonkle, pittle generation, simple packet filter, complex packet filter.

	Write core tests for chonkle, pittle and packet filter in core_test.go

	Initially, when getting everything working, magic will be held at zero.

TODO

	--------------

	Need to design how magic works between the SDK server and the backend

	I think maybe we just hold magic at zero here, and whitelisting is the approch (w. proxy potentially)

	Reason for this is that neither server init, or server init response can be encoded with the correct magic,
	since they are the method that the server KNOWS the initial magic value.

	Therefore, is there really any benefit using magic with session update? Probably not.

	Alternatively, provide a way to GET the magic, separate from the server init?

	Would this provide an attack surface? If a DDoSer could just get the magic on demand, that's not helpful :)
	
	--------------

	Update the ref backend 5 so the server5 can talk with it

	This means:

		1. server init request
		2. server init response
		3. session update

	Packets all get through and their responses are handled by the SDK.

	--------------

	Once the server5 can talk with backend5, pass over next.cpp so upgrade passes

	This means that:

		1. upgrade request
		2. upgrade response
		3. upgrade ack

	Packets all get sent, received and processed, and the client and server can exchange packets over direct packets.

	--------------

	Get the direct packet func test passing.

	--------------

	Extend the relay so it knows how to process SDK5 packets.

	--------------

	Work out how to get ping tokens down to the client

	--------------

	Get the client pinging near relays w. ping tokens and getting responses.

	--------------

	Get a func test working with a network next route.

	--------------

	Now we need to work out how to make magic dynamic.

	--------------

	Get rest of func tests passing

	--------------

	Switch the routing keypair and store it via a secret.

	Don't actually put it in the code anywhere.

	The only person who knows the keypair should be me.
