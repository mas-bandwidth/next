DONE

	Bring across the autodetect fixes from SDK 4.20.2

	Bring across server flush

	Bring across server events

	Bring across match data

	Unit tests for match data packets.

	Update match data request packet send to new way to write packets.

	Make sure match response packet receive is working.

	Bring across notify for flush.

	Server initialize with backend should have a timeout, eg. total 10 seconds.

	If the backend doesn't init within 10 seconds, go to direct only state.

	Server ready should really only happen once the initialize happens with the backend.

	If the server is in direct mode only, or network next is disabled, return from flush immediately.

	Get server and ref backend 5 talking.

	Fix server flush so it doesn't timeout.

	Get sdk5 client, server, relay and reference backend working locally.

TODO

	-----------------

	Verify func tests pass with sdk5

	-----------------

	Review func tests and check that server event, match data and server flush tests are live.

	-----------------

	Implement various func tests for multiplay autodetect via whois.

	-----------------

	There should be func tests for the client getting the ready notify.

	There should be func tests for client ready timeout, eg. long delay in whois, long delay in autodetect, long delay in server init with backend.

	There should be a test that packets are sent and received direct (not dropped), with long delays set on whois, autodetect and server init. eg. no accel but packets get in.

	Func test for disable autodetect, and no autodetect code runs.

	Func test for multiplay failure autodetect -> multiplay.cityname.

	Func test to make sure we get the datacenter name, eg. fill in a whois.txt with inap or whatever, and make sure multiplay autodetect works.

	Func test to make sure that GCP and AWS detect are on when "cloud" is passed in.

	Func test to make sure that next_server_ready is true, and datacenter is set.

	Func test to make sure that next_server_ready is true, when timeout, and datacenter is set to what is passed in.

	Should we make next_server_datacenter cache the datacenter passed in prior to ready?

	Func test to verify server fallback to direct only if the server can't talk to the backend mid-session (session update request).

	Func test to verify server fallback to direct only if the server can't init (server init request).
