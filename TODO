DONE

	Generate a random "Match ID" for each server when it starts up so I can calculate things per-match.

	Increase SDK version to 1.2.11

	Pass up to the backend in server init, server update, session update request packets.

	Update all the backends to read match id if SDK >= 1.2.11

	Add match id to all bigquery tables and pubsub avro schemas: server_init, server_update, session_summary.

	Pass the match id in through to pubsub via messages in golang.

	Deploy to dev

	Session summary, add country. Add ISP?

	Just makes it much easier to do country analysis.

	Plus, we don't have to wait for SDK update. It's in the backend right now.

	Deploy to prod.

	Verify we see country code in portal.

	Extend portal to translate from country code to local language country name in javascript.

	Verify we see country names in portal.

	Fix terraform so prod bigquery envolves schema like dev.

	Verify we see match id coming up in bigquery in dev and prod.

	Seems like we might be missing match id in dev session summary?

TODO

	Verify we see session summary with ISP, country and match id in prod.







	-----

	Portal needs a bit of a cleanup of breakpoints.

	The current version of the portal XL really can't scale down as needed.

	We need a middle version.
