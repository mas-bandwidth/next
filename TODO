DONE

	Verify staging is up!

TODO	

	Verify that we can actually see https://portal-dev.virtualgo.net up.

	-------------

	Verify that I can setup relays in dev

	-------------

	Verify that I see green in dev

	-------------












	-------------

	Configure script to set company name, modify stuff etc. Idea is run "./configure" and enter some data, and everything is setup for you. *** Zero work. ***

	Should also roll relay backend, server backend keys... api keys etc.
	
	-------------

	Automatically setup the "development" database in postgres and load the create.sql

	Looks like this can only be done with gcloud:

		gcloud sql import sql INSTANCE_NAME gs://BUCKET_NAME/IMPORT_FILE_NAME --database=DATABASE_NAME

	-------------




















































	----------

	---------- 

	Integrate map with portal

	----------

	Work out portal security model

	----------

	Finalize SDK

	----------

	Finalize UE5 plugin

	----------

	Fix singlethreaded relay

	----------

	Write documentation

	----------


























Small things:

	----------

	Sessions being out of order in the portal in staging is weird. I have no explanation for this, at the moment.

	----------

	Portal redis having 10-15 second 95th percentile write time seems bad @ 10M relays...

	----------

	Make sure the system can run with no relays in dev and production (eg. analysis only initially...)

	----------

	For providers like akamai, vultr, amazon, we need to prefix all resource names with env (because their aren't separate projects...)

	--------------

	Clean up old ip2location database files in server backend

	--------------

	Extend session update so it sends all sessions to portal below 100k sessions total, even if portal next sessions only is set

	--------------

	Y axis labels spill over the right side when they get up to 100,000, 1,000,000 etc... convert to 500K, 1M, 2M?

	--------------

	Current sessions on server doesn't seem to be correct, or at least, it is 181 when it should be just 1...

	--------------

	I need more space on a standard macbook air screen in the sessions list for longer ISP names

	Right now it is way too tight. A long ISP name would throw the whole layout off

	--------------

	Connection type detection needs to be brought back for all platforms in the SDK. On linux, connection type was 0 -> "Unknown"

	--------------

	Session counts on relays being 8 when relay backend restarts seems a bit suspicious. Are we not decrementing session counts somewhere?

	--------------

	Disable high priority threads by default on the server. It can cause problems when many server instances are run per-machine.
