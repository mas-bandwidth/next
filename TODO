DONE

	Hook up the ip2location to the new server 5 backend via handler -> state

	Disable google pubsub by default. Enable with an env var.

	Disable google bigquery by default. Enable with an env var.

	Got the raspberry pi server initing with the server backend 5 in dev.

	Got the raspberry pi client connecting to the raspberry pi server and upgrading.

TODO

	For some reason the session update packet is not getting back to the server:

    -----------------

































	-----------------

	Implement a new portal cruncher based around the service.go

	-----------------

	Extend server backend to write session update data messages to redis pubsub.

	-----------------

	Run the portal cruncher in the happy path and verify it gets the redis pubsub messages.

	-----------------

	Update the old database code to stash the "Latitude" and "Longitude" for datacenters in the parent struct, so it is compatible with the new database code.

	-----------------

	Implement func tests for each major service, especially around leader election and transfer in-situ

	-----------------

	We need to check the crypto signature on relay updates.

	-----------------












































    -----------------

    After this, it is time to plumb session update messages to analytics, then process them to perform insertion into bigquery.

    -----------------

    Once this is done, we basically have a working SDK5 backend in dev.

    -----------------

    The next step then is to setup a build process for relays in semaphore.

    -----------------

    Then extend the relay to have the concept of a "secondary" backend, which it will send relay updates to, but it will not shut down if it can't communicate with.

    -----------------

    Once this is done we can create a new prod5 environment, and set up a few relays in prod so that they use prod5 as secondary relay backend.

    -----------------

    Once this is verified stable, upgrade all relays so they report to the secondary prod5 relay backend.

	Why can't it read the cost_matrix_stats message?
