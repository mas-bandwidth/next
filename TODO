TODO

	Implement the small map in the sidebar for buyer and relay pages

	--------------

	Implement the large map in the main page

	--------------











Extra work found when finishing portal:

	--------------

	Most amazon relays are down. Why?

	--------------

	Connection type detection needs to be brought back for all platforms in the SDK. On linux, connection type was 0 -> "Unknown"

	--------------

	Extend initial delay on server cruncher and session cruncher for 120. This will delay them from becoming active until they have had a full minute + to calculate sessions

	--------------

	Session counts on relays being 8 when relay backend restarts seems a bit suspicious. Are we not decrementing session counts somewhere?

	--------------

	dev relays need to also be setup to use cloud storage for tf state?

	--------------













Finalize load test:

	-------------------

	*** Why are sessions not taking network next in load test? ***

	-----------------

	Change analytics to perform bulk inserts instead of streaming inserts.

	Bulk inserts are free.

	-------------------

	Setup google beta provider and set the tier 1 bandwidth on the server backend.

		network_performance_config {
			total_egress_bandwidth_tier = "TIER_1"
		}

	------------------

	Make sure that MAX_JITTER and MAX_PACKET_LOSS are set to a low values in prod

	------------------




























Terraform project setup:

	-----------------------

	Enable:

		Compute Engine API
		Cloud Resource Manager API
		Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis API
		Service Networking API
		Cloud SQL API

	There's a chicken and egg that needs to be fixed around the sql files, the database.bin and the "next tool" not being able to select the env until both the sql and database.bin are up.

	-----------------------
