DONE

	Leave the system running @ 1M in staging for a day.

	Verify that we have data ingestion running for the whole day with no errors.

	Some minor errors found...

	http: superfluous response.WriteHeader call from main.routeMatrixHandler (relay_backend.go:1045)

	You can't set error on the response after you write the response.

	error: fallback to direct (server backend)

	^--- turn into warning

	Errors from running overnight:

		error: failed to add time series: write tcp 10.0.0.33:50976->10.0.0.13:6379: i/o timeout (relay backend)

	I think this just means the redis time series instance is overloaded. Running it as cluster with redis enterprise should solve the issue.

TODO	

	Setup production again and verify we can hit 100k scale with raspberry

	-------------

	At this point the backend is finished!

	-------------























































	---------- 

	Integrate map with portal

	----------

	Setup projects and service accounts with terraform

	----------

	Write documentation

	----------


























Small things:

	----------

	Calling sessions "next" is fine for code, but in the portal we should refer to it as accelerated.

	That way if somebody rebrands the portal internally, stuff will still make sense vs. "next sessions" (what's that?)

	----------

	Make sure the system can run with no relays in dev and production (eg. analysis only initially...)

	----------

	Relays need to be setup to use cloud storage for tf state

	----------

	For providers like akamai, vultr, amazon, we need to prefix all resource names with env (because their aren't separate projects...)

	--------------

	Clean up old ip2location database files in server backend

	--------------

	User hash link in server sessions page is not working

	--------------

	Just leave the buyer page as graphs. The rightmost column doesn't add enough to justify its existence.

	--------------

	Click on server to see sessions on server is broken in staging even at small load. My guess, sessions are not properly linking to server addresses?

	--------------

	Active relays seems to double during deploys. Currently, I cannot think of any reason why this would happen?

	--------------

	Extend session update so it sends all sessions to portal below 100k sessions total, even if portal next sessions only is set

	--------------

	Relay graphs need to be aggregated (time series) into per-minute values. Use average.

	--------------

	Y axis labels spill over the right side when they get up to 100,000, 1,000,000 etc... convert to 500K, 1M, 2M?

	--------------

	Current sessions on server doesn't seem to be correct, or at least, it is 181 when it should be just 1...

	--------------

	I need more space on a standard macbook air screen in the sessions list for longer ISP names

	Right now it is way too tight. A long ISP name would throw the whole layout off

	--------------

	There will be a challenge getting prod relays up in AWS vs. dev. There are no projects to segregate?

	Might need to create a separate project, or distinguish resources with naming convention.

	--------------

	Connection type detection needs to be brought back for all platforms in the SDK. On linux, connection type was 0 -> "Unknown"

	--------------

	Session counts on relays being 8 when relay backend restarts seems a bit suspicious. Are we not decrementing session counts somewhere?

	--------------

	Probably good to provide a way to disable the high priority threads on server with env var.

	When many server instances are running on one server, this can cause problems. eg. thread starvation

	--------------






Finalize SDK and UE5 plugin:

	------------------

	Update to latest PS4 and PS5 SDK on Windows PC

	Verify that we can build, link and run across PS4

	Verify that we can build, link and run across PS5

	------------------

	Update to latest XDK

	Verify that we can build, link and run across XBoxOne

	Verify that we can build, link and run across SeriesX

	------------------

	Setup PS4 compilation with custom agents

	Setup PS5 compilation with custom agents

	Setup XBoxOne compilation with custom agents

	Setup Series X compilation with custom agents

	------------------

	Get the UE5 plugin back up

	Make sure to include Flush on the server before the server is destroyed
