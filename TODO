DONE

	Fix as many packet sends as possible to use the new functions.

TODO

	Get the client/server upgrade working and the upgraded direct packets being exchanged between client and server.

	--------------

	Update the func backend 5 so it can handle new SDK5 packet types.v

	--------------

	Update the reference relay so it can handle the new SDK5 packet types.

	--------------

	Get an actual end-to-end network next route going with SDK5 client/server.

	--------------

	Get the func tests passing.

	--------------

	Now work out how to get the advanced packet filter working, with magic held at 0.

	--------------

	Now work out how to have non-zero magic for packets

	--------------




























	--------------

	Get the direct packet func test passing.

	--------------

	Extend the relay so it knows how to process SDK5 packets.

	--------------

	Work out how to get ping tokens down to the client

	--------------

	Get the client pinging near relays w. ping tokens and getting responses.

	--------------

	Get a func test working with a network next route.

	--------------

	Now we need to work out how to make magic dynamic.

	--------------

	Get rest of func tests passing

	--------------

	Switch the routing keypair and store it via a secret.

	Don't actually put it in the code anywhere.

	The only person who knows the keypair should be me.

	--------------

	Move server whois to the backend, it's unreliable when run on the SDK server
	and the iteration time for fixes (new SDK deploy) is just too long.
