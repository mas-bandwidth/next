DONE

	Implement counters for buyer servers and buyer sessions

	Update API to get all buyer related server and session counts from counters

	Make sure all admin graphs work in dev

	Make sure all relay graphs work in dev

	Verify session sort order is correct in dev

	Make sure all buyer counts work in dev

	Get buyer graphs working in dev

	Need to do something about counters graphs showing zeros

	Add the active relays graph

	Verify active relays graph in dev

TODO

	Verify active relays graph in admin

	Verify active relays graph in buyer view

	-----------------------

	Scale up to 1M in staging with 10% next

	Scale up to 10M in staging with 10% next

	Verify that we don't see any redis time series stretched dots @ 10M

	Scale up to 25M in staging with 10% next

	Verify that we don't see any redis time series stretched dots @ 25M

	Verify we can scale down sessions and they don't get stuck up high

	-----------------------

	Extend session update so it sends all sessions to portal below 100k sessions total, even if portal next sessions only is set

	---------------

	We need to see a steady route matrix across deploys. Work out what is going on with leader election and the new instance sending time series and counter data

	---------------



































































	--------------

	Add "portal_cruncher" counter. We need to see the throughput of the portal cruncher, to see if it is getting backed up or behind.

	--------------

	Number of routes is going up/down a lot even in dev. Is the minute history buffer long enough?

	--------------
	
















	--------------

	There seems to be a load related issue @ 1000 relays.

	--------------

	Change analytics to perform bulk inserts instead of streaming inserts.

	--------------













Small things:

	--------------

	Y axis labels spill over the right side when they get up to 100,000, 1,000,000 etc... convert to 500K, 1M, 2M?

	--------------

	Current sessions on server doesn't seem to be correct, or at least, it is 181 when it should be just 1...

	--------------

	uPlot graphs really need to calculate the real maximum from the data passed in

	In so many cases, they fail to calculate it. It's extremely annoying.

	--------------

	I need more space on a standard macbook air screen in the sessions list for longer ISP names

	Right now it is way too tight. A long ISP name would throw the whole layout off

	--------------

	There will be a challenge getting prod relays up in AWS vs. dev. There are no projects to segregate?

	Might need to create a separate project, or distinguish resources with naming convention.

	--------------

	Connection type detection needs to be brought back for all platforms in the SDK. On linux, connection type was 0 -> "Unknown"

	--------------

	Session counts on relays being 8 when relay backend restarts seems a bit suspicious. Are we not decrementing session counts somewhere?

	--------------

	Probably good to provide a way to disable the high priority threads on server with env var.

	When many server instances are running on one server, this can cause problems. eg. thread starvation

	--------------










Finalize terraform and document:

	--------------

	Setup projects and service accounts with terraform

	--------------

	Relays need to be setup to use cloud storage for tf state

	--------------








Finalize SDK and UE5 plugin:

	------------------

	Update to latest PS4 and PS5 SDK on Windows PC

	Verify that we can build, link and run across PS4

	Verify that we can build, link and run across PS5

	------------------

	Update to latest XDK

	Verify that we can build, link and run across XBoxOne

	Verify that we can build, link and run across SeriesX

	------------------

	Setup PS4 compilation with custom agents

	Setup PS5 compilation with custom agents

	Setup XBoxOne compilation with custom agents

	Setup Series X compilation with custom agents

	------------------

	Get the UE5 plugin back up

	Make sure to include Flush on the server before the server is destroyed
