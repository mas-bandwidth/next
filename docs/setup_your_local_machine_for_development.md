# Setup for Development

In this section you will setup your local development environment so you can build the Network Next source, run unit tests, and run the "happy path" to verify the system is working correctly.

Setup depends on whether you are developing on Linux or MacOS. Development on Windows is not supported.

# Setup on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)

1. Install dependencies

	`sudo apt install build-essential redis-server postgresql libcurl4-openssl-dev pkg-config -y`

2. Install libsodium

    `wget https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.18-stable.tar.gz && tar -zxf libsodium-1.0.18-stable.tar.gz && cd libsodium-stable && ./configure && make -j && make check && sudo make install && sudo ldconfig && cd ~`

3. Install latest golang

	Find the latest Linux golang download here: https://go.dev/doc/install

	Then do this, with the latest download URL for your platform:

	`wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz && sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go*.tar.gz`

4. Add . and go to your path

	Modify ~/.profile to include:

	`echo "export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH:." >> ~/.profile`

	Then source it:

	`source ~/.profile`

5. Configure postgres

   `psql -U postgres -h localhost -c "CREATE USER developer; ALTER USER developer WITH SUPERUSER;"`

   If this step fails, you may need to work around the default postgres account requiring logging in as the user postgres.

   See https://blog.jcharistech.com/2022/09/07/logging-into-postgresql-without-password-prompt/ for a workaround. Apply the "trust" setting to the 127.0.0.1 and ::1 lines in pg_hba.conf then `sudo systemctl restart postgresql` and you should be able to run the step above without being prompted for a password.   

7. Go to the next directory at the command line

    `cd ~/next`

8. Select local environment

   `next select local`

9. Build and run unit tests

   `make`

You should see output like:

```console
root@linux:~/next# make build
dist/func_test_terraform
dist/func_test_sdk
dist/func_test_database
dist/relay-debug
dist/func_test_api

11. Run happy path

    `run happy-path`

You should output like:

```console

Next step: [Setup Prerequisites](setup_prerequisites.md).

# Setup on MacOS

1. Install brew from https://brew.sh

   `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

2. Install dependencies

   `brew install golang redis libsodium pkg-config postgresql@14`

3. Start redis

   `brew services start redis`

4. Start postgres

   `brew services start postgresql@14`

5. Configure postgres

   `psql -c "CREATE USER developer; ALTER USER developer WITH SUPERUSER;"`

   `brew services start postgresql@14`

6. Add . to your path

   Modify ~/.zshrc to include:

   `export PATH=.:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH`
