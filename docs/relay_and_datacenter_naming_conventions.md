# Datacenter and relay naming conventions

A full production system has thousands of datacenters and several hundred relays.

Let's keep them all organized with a clear naming convention for datacenters and relays.

## 1. Datacenter naming convention

Each datacenter must be named:

* [seller].[cityname].[number]

For example:

* google.losangeles.1
* google.losangeles.2
* amazon.virginia.5

In cases where there is only one datacenter in a city, the number may be omitted.

* i3d.istanbul
* stackpath.newyork
