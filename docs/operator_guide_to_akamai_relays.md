# Operator guide to Akamai relays

This section describes how to use the Network Next terraform provider together with the Akamai terraform provider to spin up Akamai relays (previously Linode.com).

Akamai recently acquired Linode. Prior to the aquisition I did not find the Linode network to be incredibly performant. Presumably, Akamai will use this acquisition to deploy more compute in their datacenters over time so this platform should hopefully mature into a good source of relays. There is a general trend where network providers and CDNs are starting to offer edge compute offerings in their datacenters. Hopefully that is the plan here for Akamai.

Right now I'm mostly including it mostly because Linode had a terraform provider and it was easy to implement as a test case. The existence of this tool is not an endorsement of the quality of Akamai/Linode relays.

## 1. The akamai config tool

The akamai config tool is to extracts configuration data from your Akamai account and gets it into a form where it can be used to create relays. 

The akamai config tool is run automatically when you run `next config` along with config for other sellers, but if you want to run the akamai config by itself, just go:

```
run config-akamai
```

The akamai config tool lives in `~/next/sellers/akamai.go`. 

When the akamai config tool runs, it caches data under `~/next/cache` to speed up its operation next time it runs. It generates `~/next/terraform/sellers/akamai/generated.tf` and `~/next/config/akamai.txt`.

The `akamai.txt` file is currently unused, but in future it could be used by the SDK to perform datacenter autodetection in Akamai datacenters. It's mostly emitted for completeness.

## 2. Adding new datacenters in Akamai

When you run the akamai config tool via `run config-akamai`, you will see an output describing the set of datacenters in Akamai:

```console
gaffer@batman next % run config-akamai

Known datacenters:

  akamai.mumbai
  akamai.toronto
  akamai.sydney
  akamai.dallas
  akamai.fremont
  akamai.atlanta
  akamai.newyork
  akamai.london
  akamai.singapore
  akamai.frankfurt

Unknown datacenters:

  us-iad
  us-ord
  fr-par
  us-sea
  br-gru
  nl-ams
  se-sto
  in-maa
  jp-osa
  it-mil
  us-mia
  id-cgk
  us-lax
```

Here we can see that Akamai has been busy. There are a bunch of unknown datacenters. These are new datacenters available in Akamai that have not been mapped to Network Next datacenters yet.

To fix this, you would just go into sellers/akamai.go and modify the datacenter map to add these new datacenters:

```
// This definition drives the set of akamai datacenters, eg. "akamai.[country/city]"

var datacenterMap = map[string]*Datacenter{

	"ap-west":      {"mumbai", 19.0760, 72.8777},
	"ca-central":   {"toronto", 43.6532, -79.3832},
	"ap-southeast": {"sydney", -33.8688, 151.2093},
	"us-central":   {"dallas", 32.7767, -96.7970},
	"us-west":      {"fremont", 37.5485, -121.9886},
	"us-southeast": {"atlanta", 33.7488, -84.3877},
	"us-east":      {"newyork", 40.7128, -74.0060},
	"eu-west":      {"london", 51.5072, -0.1276},
	"ap-south":     {"singapore", 1.3521, 103.8198},
	"eu-central":   {"frankfurt", 50.1109, 8.6821},
	"ap-northeast": {"tokyo", 35.6762, 139.6503},
}
```

For example "us-lax" is Los Angeles. To add a mapping for it you would add an entry like this:

```
	"us-lax":       {"losangeles", 34.0522, -118.2437},
```

The numbers after the city name are latitude and longitude. The location doesn't need to be exact for where the servers are located. Center of the city is fine.

Please make sure to follow [naming conventions](datacenter_and_relay_naming_conventions.md) when you add a new datacenter.


-------------------

## 3. Update database with your new datacenters

Depending on your environment you are changing, change into either `~/next/terraform/dev/relays` or `~/next/terraform/prod/relays`.

For example, for dev:

```console
cd ~/next/terraform/dev/relays
terraform apply
```

Once this completes, it will have mutated your Postgres SQL instance in your Network Next env to add the new amazon datacenters.

## 4. Commit updated database.bin to the backend runtime

The backend runtime does not directly talk with Postgres SQL. Instead they get their configuration from a database.bin file, which is an extracted version of the configuration data stored in Postgres.

To make your Postgres SQL changes active in the backend, you must extract this database.bin and commit it to the backend, after you make changes to Postgres.

For example, for dev:

```console
cd ~/next
next select dev
next database
next commit
```

It takes up to 60 seconds for the runtime backend to pick up your committed database.bin.

After this point, you should be able to load up the portal and see the new datacenters you added for AWS.

## 5. Spin up relays in AWS.

It's ridiculously easy! Take a look at `~/next/sellers/amazon.go`.

There are two data structures in here. One for dev relays, and one for prod relays:

```
// DEV RELAYS

var devRelayMap = map[string][]string{
	"amazon.virginia.1": {"amazon.virginia.1", "m5a.large", "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"},
	"amazon.virginia.2": {"amazon.virginia.2", "m5a.large", "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"},
	"amazon.ohio.1":     {"amazon.ohio.1", "m5a.large", "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"},
	"amazon.ohio.2":     {"amazon.ohio.2", "m5a.large", "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"},
	"amazon.stockholm.1":  {"amazon.stockholm.1", "m5.large", "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"},
	"amazon.stockholm.2":  {"amazon.stockholm.2", "m5.large", "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"},
	"amazon.stockholm.3":  {"amazon.stockholm.3", "m5.large", "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"},
}

// PROD RELAYS

var prodRelayMap = map[string][]string{
	"amazon.virginia.1": {"amazon.virginia.1", "m5a.large", "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"},
	"amazon.virginia.2": {"amazon.virginia.2", "m5a.large", "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"},
	"amazon.ohio.1":     {"amazon.ohio.1", "m5a.large", "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"},
	"amazon.ohio.2":     {"amazon.ohio.2", "m5a.large", "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"},
	"amazon.oregon.1":   {"amazon.oregon.1", "m5a.large", "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"},
	"amazon.sanjose.1":  {"amazon.sanjose.1", "m5a.large", "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"},
}
```

To add a new relay just create a new entry in the map for your relay. You'll need to select the correct instance type you want, which can vary depending on the datacenter you are picking.

You can see a list of instance types here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#AvailableInstanceTypes

But you'll really want to use the AWS console to check the instance types available in the region and zone you want to run a relay in.

After adding a new relay, run the amazon config tool again:

```console
run amazon-config
```

And it will generate the terraform script to create the relays.

Then change into the terraform directory depending on env, for example in dev go:

```console
cd ~/next/terraform/dev/relays
terraform apply
```

It's common to have to iterate back and forth a bit, for example if the instance type is not available in the datacenter then AWS will error out here until you pick an instance type that is available.

Once the terraform apply has completed successfully, remember that you must once again commit the database.bin to the backend runtime for your changes to take effect. For example:

```console
cd ~/next
next select dev
next database
next commit
```

Next you then need to connect to your VPN (cannot SSH into relays except from your VPN address), then setup the new relays:

```console
next setup amazon
```

This loads the relay service on all amazon relays in your system, skipping over any that are already setup.

Once the setup is complete, you can check your amazon relays are online with:

```console
gaffer@batman next % next relays amazon

```

You can also go to the portal and you should see your new relays there as well.
