# Fork the Network Next repository on github

To get started you need to fork the 'next' repository to create your own version of the Network Next codebase.

1. Create your own github account and organization at http://github.com

We will add your github id to the list of accounts authorized to access the network next github repository.

4. Fork the repository to your own github account

5. Clone the forked repository to your local disk under a directory called 'next'

_You are now ready to [run a local instance with docker compose](run_local_instance_with_docker_compose.md)._
