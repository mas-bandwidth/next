# Setup Semaphore CI to Build and Deploy Artifacts

Network Next uses semaphore ci to run tests, build artifacts and upload them to google cloud storage buckets.

You should already have a semaphore ci account setup. Now we're going to setup that account with secrets, so it has permission to upload to google cloud and interact with terraform to perform deploys on your behalf.

## 1. Build secrets.tar.gz

Run this at the command line:

`cd ~/next && next secrets`

This program will run and provide you with output like this:

```console
gaffer@batman next % next secrets

copying secrets from terraform/projects to ~/secrets...

zipping up secrets -> secrets.tar.gz

secrets.tar.gz is ready
```

In the ~/next directory you will now see a secrets.tar.gz file. This is just a zip containing the contents of your ~/secrets directory. Please back this file up somewhere.

## 2. Upload secrets to semaphore ci

Go to https://semaphoreci.com, click on your organization icon in the the top right, and select "Settings" in the drop down menu:

Now in the left menu, select "Secrets":

Click on the blue "Create Secret" button, and in the dialog, set the name of the secret to "secrets", give the secret a configuration filename of "/home/semaphore/secrets/secrets.tar.gz", and upload the secrets.tar.gz file you generated in the previous step.

Save the secret. Now the semaphore jobs (defined in ~/next/.semaphore/*.yml) will have access to secrets, so they can upload files and perform deploys.

## 3. Verify semaphore is working

In the main page of semaphoreci.com while you are logged in, you should see a list of jobs that have run, chronologically.

Semaphore is already configured to build and run tests on each commit, so you should see tests that succeeded for your "keygen" and "config" commits earlier.

Click on the most recent successful job.

You should see something like this:

Click on "Update Golang Cache" and wait for the task to complete. This may take around 5 minutes, but after this task completes, golang builds in semaphore will run much more quickly, finishing build and test in less than one minute for each commit.

Once the golang cache is updated, click on "Upload Config" and "Upload Relay" jobs and wait for these to succeed. They should complete quickly.

These tasks will upload some files to google cloud buckets needed by later deploy steps. When they succeed, you can be certain that you have configured semaphore secrets correctly.
