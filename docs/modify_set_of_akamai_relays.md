# Modify set of akamai relays

Open the file "terraform/dev/relays/main.tf" and replace the Akamai relays section:

```terraform
# =============
# AKAMAI RELAYS
# =============

locals {

  akamai_relays = {

    "akamai.newyork" = {
      datacenter_name = "akamai.newyork"
      type            = "g6-dedicated-2"
      image           = "linode/ubuntu22.04"
    },

    "akamai.atlanta" = {
      datacenter_name = "akamai.atlanta"
      type            = "g6-dedicated-2"
      image           = "linode/ubuntu22.04"
    },

    "akamai.fremont" = {
      datacenter_name = "akamai.fremont"
      type            = "g6-dedicated-2"
      image           = "linode/ubuntu22.04"
    }
    
    "akamai.dallas" = {
      datacenter_name = "akamai.dallas"
      type            = "g6-dedicated-2"
      image           = "linode/ubuntu22.04"
    }

  }
}
```

With this:

```terraform
# =============
# AKAMAI RELAYS
# =============

locals {

  akamai_relays = {

    "akamai.newyork" = {
      datacenter_name = "akamai.newyork"
      type            = "g6-dedicated-2"
      image           = "linode/ubuntu22.04"
    },

    "akamai.atlanta" = {
      datacenter_name = "akamai.atlanta"
      type            = "g6-dedicated-2"
      image           = "linode/ubuntu22.04"
    },

    "akamai.dallas" = {
      datacenter_name = "akamai.dallas"
      type            = "g6-dedicated-2"
      image           = "linode/ubuntu22.04"
    }

    "akamai.miami" = {
      datacenter_name = "akamai.miami"
      type            = "g6-dedicated-2"
      image           = "linode/ubuntu22.04"
    }

    "akamai.saopaulo" = {
      datacenter_name = "akamai.saopaulo"
      type            = "g6-dedicated-2"
      image           = "linode/ubuntu22.04"
    }

  }
}
```

Check in your changes:

```console
git commit -am "change akamai relays"
git push origin
```

Then run terraform:

```console
cd ~/next/terraform/dev/relays
terraform apply
```

And commit the database to the backend to make it active:

```console
cd ~/next
next database
next commit
```

Wait a few minutes for the relays to initialize...

Connect to the VPN, then setup the new akamai relays:

```console
next setup akamai
```

After about 5 minutes the new relays should be online:

```console
next relays akamai
```
