# Operator guide to bare metal relays

This section describes how to use the Network Next terraform provider to configure bare metal relays.

Typically, bare metal means anything that's not cloud. But in this context, bare metal means any relays that you have manually provisioned without using terraform, and you can now SSH in and you want to turn that linux machine into a relay.

## 1. Create a new seller module in terraform

First we need to set up a module for the new seller in terraform.

Datapacket.com (https://datapacket.com) is an _excellent_ bare metal provider for relays. But they don't have a terraform provider so you have to configure them manually.

Let's start by configuring a seller in terraform called "datapacket".

1. Create a new folder under `~/next/sellers` called "datapacket".
2. Copy the template `main.tf` from `~/next/sellers/bare_metal/main.tf` into your `sellers/datapacket` directory.

Open your copy of `main.tf` in a text editor. You'll see:

```
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

variable "relays" { type = map(map(string)) }

locals {

  seller_name = "[Your seller]"

  seller_code = "[seller]"

  ssh_user = "root"

  datacenter_map = {

    "[seller].cityname" = {
      latitude    = 10.00
      longitude   = 20.00
      native_name = ""
      seller_name = local.seller_name
      seller_code = local.seller_code
    }

  }

}

output "relays" {
  description = "All relays for [seller]"
  value = {
    for k, v in var.relays : k => zipmap( 
      [
        "relay_name", 
        "datacenter_name",
        "seller_name",
        "seller_code",
        "public_address", 
        "internal_address", 
        "internal_group", 
        "ssh_address", 
        "ssh_user",
      ], 
      [
        k,
        v.datacenter_name,
        local.seller_name,
        local.seller_code,
        v.public_address, 
        "", 
        0, 
        v.public_address, 
        local.ssh_user,
      ]
    )
  }
}

output "datacenters" {
  description = "All datacenters for [seller]"
  value = locals.datacenter_map
}

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Replace "[seller]" with "datapacket", and "[Your seller]" with "Datapacket" and save the file.

## 2. Define seller datacenters in terraform

Go to https://datapacket.com and see what datacenters they have. At the time of writing, they have the following datacenters:

* stockholm
* copenhagen
* dublin
* london
* amsterdam
* warsaw
* kyiv
* frankfurt
* brussels
* zurich
* prague
* bratislava
* paris
* vienna
* bucharest
* milan
* zagreb
* sofia
* lisbon
* madrid
* marseille
* palermo
* athens
* istanbul
* telaviv
* johanesburg
* sydney
* singapore
* hongkong
* tokyo
* queretaro
* bogota
* saopaulo
* santiago
* vancouver
* seattle
* denver
* sanjose
* losangeles
* chicago
* toronto
* boston
* newyork
* losangeles
* dallas
* houston
* mcallen
* miami
* ashburn
* atlanta

Go through each datacenter and add an entry in the datacenter map. You'll need to look up the approximate lat/long of each city. Take special care with signs on the lat/long values.

You can also use the "native_name" field to map the Network Next name to any supplier specific codename they have for each location. In this case, there is no such code name per-location for datapacket.com, so it's left blank.

The "seller_name" and "seller_code" fields link your datacenter to the datapacket seller.

```
  datacenter_map = {

    "datapacket.losangeles" = {
      latitude    = 34.0522
      longitude   = -118.2437
      native_name = ""
      seller_name = local.seller_name
      seller_code = local.seller_code
    },

    "datapacket.chicago" = {
      latitude    = 41.8781
      longitude   = -87.6298
      native_name = ""
      seller_name = local.seller_name
      seller_code = local.seller_code
    },

    etc...
  }
```

Once all the datacenters are added to `datapacket/main.tf` save the file, add it to git and check in.

ps. If there was a REST API for datapacket, then you could create your own datapacket config tool in sellers/datapacket.go and set it up to automatically generate the datacenter map for you in `terraform/sellers/datapacket/generated.tf` instead of doing this step manually.

## 3. Link the seller to dev/prod relays terraform script

Now we need to link up the datapacket module so it's used by dev and prod relay terraform scripts.

In `~/terraform/dev/relays/terraform.tfvars` and `~/terraform/prod/relays/terraform.tfvars` add datapacket to the list of sellers:

```
sellers = {
	"Akamai" = "akamai"
	"Amazon" = "amazon"
	"Google" = "google"
	"Datapacket" = "datapacket"
}
```

Then in `~/terraform/dev/relays/main.tf` and `~/terraform/prod/relays/main.tf` add a section for datapacket relays and create an instance of the datapacket module:

```
# =================
# DATAPACKET RELAYS
# =================

locals {

  datapacket_relays = {

    // ...

  }
}

module "datapacket_relays" {
  relays = local.datapacket_relays
  source = "../../sellers/datapacket"
}
```

Next, link up the datapacket relays and datacenters to the Network Next terraform provider by adding entries for datapacket in the local vars. 

These variables are used to create the sets of all relays and all datacenters in the Network Next Postgres database.

```
# =======================
# INITIALIZE DEV DATABASE
# =======================

# Setup sellers, datacenters and relays in dev

locals {
  
  relay_names = sort(
    concat(
      keys(module.google_relays.relays),
      keys(module.amazon_relays.relays),
      keys(module.akamai_relays.relays),
      keys(module.datapacket_relays.relays),
    )
  )

  relays = merge(
    module.google_relays.relays,
    module.amazon_relays.relays,
    module.akamai_relays.relays,
    module.datapacket_relays.relays,
  )

  datacenters = merge(
    module.google_relays.datacenters,
    module.amazon_relays.datacenters,
    module.akamai_relays.datacenters,
    module.datapacket_relays.datacenters,
  )

  datacenter_names = distinct([for k, relay in local.relays : relay.datacenter_name])
}
```

Run `terraform init` (required because we have a new module), then `terraform apply` to make the changes to Postgres SQL for your new datapacket seller and datacenters, then commit the database.bin to your environment.

For example, in dev:

```console
cd ~/next/terraform/dev/relays
terraform init
terraform apply
cd ~/next
next select dev
next database
next commit
```

Now you should be able to go to the dev portal and see the "Datapacket" seller in there, with all the datapacket datacenters added. You may need to use the 1/2 keys to scroll left/right in the datacenter list to see them.

## 4. Provision relay

Order a bare metal server from datapacket.com at the datacenter you want. It should be running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64bit

Here is the script you need to run on the relay:

```
#!/bin/sh
if [[ -f /etc/setup_relay_completed ]]; then exit 0; fi
echo sshd: ALL > hosts.deny
echo sshd: $VPN_ADDRESS > hosts.allow
sudo mv hosts.deny /etc/hosts.deny
sudo mv hosts.allow /etc/hosts.allow
sudo touch /etc/setup_relay_has_run
sudo journalctl --vacuum-size 10M
sudo NEEDRESTART_SUSPEND=1 apt autoremove -y
sudo NEEDRESTART_SUSPEND=1 apt update -y
sudo NEEDRESTART_SUSPEND=1 apt upgrade -y
sudo NEEDRESTART_SUSPEND=1 apt dist-upgrade -y
sudo NEEDRESTART_SUSPEND=1 apt install libcurl3-gnutls build-essential vim -y
sudo NEEDRESTART_SUSPEND=1 apt autoremove -y
wget https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.18.tar.gz
tar -zxf libsodium-1.0.18.tar.gz
cd libsodium-1.0.18
./configure
make -j
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
sudo touch /etc/setup_relay_completed
```

This script does a few things:

1. Installs curl, vim, and build essential tools
2. Installs libsodium (crypto library used by the relay)
3. Sets up the relay so you can only SSH in from the VPN address. You'll need to manually edit the script and set the VPN address yourself

It does not actually install the relay software. That's done in the setup step later on. 

If the provider does not provide a way to setup the machine for you with a public SSH key, you'll need to manually set the Linux machine so you can log in with your SSH key. The key used for SSHing into relays is ~/secrets/next_ssh.pub by default. 

Instructions for setting this up are here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server

You should also configure the relay to disallow password based authentication, and only accept SSH based login.

Finally, if necessary depending on the provider, make sure that UDP port 40000 is open in the firewall.

## 5. Add relay to terraform

Go back to your `relays/main.tf` file for your environment.

Now we want to add an entry for the "datapacket.losangeles" relay so it's linked to the Network Next database. For example:

```
# =================
# DATAPACKET RELAYS
# =================

locals {

  datapacket_relays = {

    "datapacket.losangeles" = {
      datacenter_name = "datapacket.losangeles"
      public_address  = "185.152.67.2"
    },

  }
}

module "datapacket_relays" {
  relays = local.datapacket_relays
  source = "../../sellers/datapacket"
}
```

Then run `terraform apply` to add the relay to the Postgres database.

Once terraform apply completes, commit the database.

```console
cd ~/next
next select dev
next database
next commit
```

## 6. Setup the relay

Now the relay is logically created, but not setup yet with the relay software.

Connect to your VPN then run:

```
next setup datapacket.losangeles
```

Once the setup completes, the relay should be visible and come online:

```
next relays datapacket
```

You should also be able to see the relay in the portal and it should start carrying traffic after 5 minutes.
