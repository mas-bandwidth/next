# What benefit does Network Next provide for your game?

The Internet is a technological marvel, in 2023 we can watch streaming video, zoom with friends on the other side of the world and chat with friends wherever they are. Bandwidth available has never been higher, and we can download large files almost instantly that just 10 or 20 years ago would have taken days. But, in the same time period, progress on quality of service (QoS) metrics such as latency, jitter and packet loss have been virtually non-existant.

In 2023, bandwidth available has never been higher, but progress on quality of service (QoS) metrics such as latency, jitter and packet loss are virtually non-existant. The average packet loss around the world is 0.15%. In many areas of the world, the average packet loss is significantly higher. Of course, averages lie and players experience _worse_ than the average on a regular basis.

Latency too is terrible. Players in Sao Paulo, Brazil will experience 200ms+ additional latency to servers hosted in... Sao Paulo, as their ISP routes their traffic the wrong way. But for these players it only happens 1 in every 5 or so matches because the hash of IP addresses and ports load balances their traffic up a higher latency upstream link for their ISP. Friday night, the entire Comcast backbone goes down on the East Coast, and players get an additional 100ms latency while playing until it's fixed sometime next week. Players in Dubai randomly transit to datacenters in Dubai, via Frankfurt. Korean players get higher latency than necessary when playing with players in Japan, and vice versa because historical geopolicitics, and don't get us started about players in the Middle East. Heirarchical routing and a preference for the cheapest link means that players in Sao Paulo transit to Miami via New York, with an additional 150ms latency, because that's the cheapest link from Sao Paulo to the USA. The list goes on. We have seen things you people would _never_ believe.

# A lack of consistency

Data from more than 25M unique players through Network Next shows that at any time, 10% of players experience significantly degraded network performance. This is true no matter where you host your game servers. In cloud, bare metal, even if that network provider claims to have the best network in the world with their own private backbone.

And each month, this bad network performance moves around, affecting more than 60% of your players at least once.

What we have here is a _lack of consistency_. The Internet often provides good network performance for games, but this performance randomly changes and from one match to the next match, players experience wildly different network performance, causing player frustration and churn.
