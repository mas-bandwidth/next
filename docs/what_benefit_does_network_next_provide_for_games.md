# What benefit does Network Next provide for your game?

## The Internet doesn't care about your game

The Internet is a technological marvel, in 2023 we can watch streaming video, zoom with friends on the other side of the world and chat with friends wherever they are. Bandwidth available has never been higher, and we can download large files almost instantly that just 10 or 20 years ago would have taken days. But, in the same time period, progress on quality of service (QoS) metrics such as latency, jitter and packet loss have been virtually non-existant.

Data from more than 25M unique players through Network Next shows that _at any time 10% of players are experiencing significantly degraded network performance_. This is true no matter where you host your game servers. In cloud, bare metal, even if that network provider claims to have the best network in the world with their own private backbone. And each month, this bad network performance moves around, affecting more than _60% of your players at least once_.

But just how bad is it? The average packet loss around the world is 0.15%. In many areas of the world, the average packet loss is significantly higher. Of course, averages lie and players experience _worse_ than the average on a regular basis. Latency too is terrible. Players in Sao Paulo, Brazil experience 150ms+ additional latency as they are routed to Miami through... New York. Friday night, the entire Comcast backbone goes down on the East Coast, and all players on the East Coast players get an additional 100ms latency while playing until it's fixed sometime next week. A transit link is overloaded Friday night during peak play time and packet loss spikes. Players in Dubai randomly transit to datacenters in Dubai, via Frankfurt. Korean players get higher latency than necessary when playing with players in Japan because of geopolitics, and don't get us started about players in the Middle East.

## Bad network performance reduces engagement, retention and monetization

Data from multiple games shows a consistent link between network performance and KPIs for your game.

As latency and packet loss increases, engagement, retention and monetization reduces.

The exact thr

## A lack of consistency

What we have here is a lack of consistency. While network performance is often good, it is not consistent, and there is no guarantee from one match to another that it is. 

Network Next is designed to solve this problem

Network Next is designed to solve this problem. When a player is routed the wrong way or encounters higher packet loss or jitter than usual, we route them anothre way. We combat packet loss by sending packets redundantly down multiple distinct routes, and we only accelerate players when they would otherwise experience 

## Accelerate players only when it matters
