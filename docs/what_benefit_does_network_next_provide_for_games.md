# What benefit does Network Next provide for your game?

The Internet is a technological marvel, we can watch streaming video, zoom with friends on the other side of the world and chat with friends wherever they are. In 2023, bandwidth available has never been higher, but progress on quality of service (QoS) metrics such as latency, jitter and packet loss are virtually non-existant.

Data from more than 25M unique players shows that at any time, around 10% of your player experience significantly degraded network performance. This is true no matter where you host your game servers. In cloud, bare metal, even if that network provider claims to have the best network in the world with their own private backbone.

Each month, no matter where you host your servers, more than 60% of your players experience bad network performance. What this means is that bad network performance moves around, and doesn't just affect the same 10% of players all the time. It really is, a systemic problems in the Internet that randomly gives your players a bad experience playing your game.

The average packet loss around the world is 0.15%. In many areas of the world, the average packet loss is significantly higher. Of course, averages lie and players experience _worse_ than the average on a regular basis. Every month, 90% of your players will experience high packet loss at some point.

Latency too is terrible. Players in Sao Paulo, Brazil will experience 200ms+ additional latency to servers hosted in... Sao Paulo, as their ISP routes their traffic the wrong way. But for these players it only happens 1 in every 5 or so matches because the hash of IP addresses and ports load balances their traffic up a higher latency upstream link for their ISP. Friday night, the entire Comcast backbone goes down on the East Coast, and players get an additional 100ms latency while playing until it's fixed, sometime next week. Players in Dubai randomly transit to datacenters in Dubai, via Frankfurt. Korean players get higher latency than necessary when playing with players in Japan, and vice versa because historical geopolicitics between the two countries is poor and optimal interlinks between the countries are not planned. And don't get us started about players in the Middle East. Heirarchical routing means that players in Sao Paulo transit to Miami through New York, because the cheapest link from Sao Paulo to the USA is through New York. The list goes on. We have seen things you people would _never_ believe.
